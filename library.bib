abstract = {Background: Droplet-based single-cell RNA sequence analyses assume that all acquired RNAs are endogenous to cells. However, any cell-free RNAs contained within the input solution are also captured by these assays. This sequencing of cell-free RNA constitutes a background contamination that confounds the biological interpretation of single-cell transcriptomic data. Results: We demonstrate that contamination from this”soup” of cell-free RNAs is ubiquitous, with experiment-specific variations in composition and magnitude. We present a method, SoupX, for quantifying the extent of the contamination and estimating”background-corrected” cell expression profiles that seamlessly integrate with existing downstream analysis tools. Applying this method to several datasets using multiple droplet sequencing technologies, we demonstrate that its application improves biological interpretation of otherwise misleading data, as well as improving quality control metrics. Conclusions: We present SoupX, a tool for removing ambient RNA contamination from droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing experiments. This tool has broad applicability, and its application can improve the biological utility of existing and future datasets.},

abstract = {Background: Multilevel data integration is becoming a major area of research in systems biology. Within this area, multi-'omics datasets on complex diseases are becoming more readily available and there is a need to set standards and good practices for integrated analysis of biological, clinical and environmental data. We present a framework to plan and generate single and multi-'omics signatures of disease states. Methods: The framework is divided into four major steps: dataset subsetting, feature filtering, 'omics-based clustering and biomarker identification. Results: We illustrate the usefulness of this framework by identifying potential patient clusters based on integrated multi-'omics signatures in a publicly available ovarian cystadenocarcinoma dataset. The analysis generated a higher number of stable and clinically relevant clusters than previously reported, and enabled the generation of predictive models of patient outcomes. Conclusions: This framework will help health researchers plan and perform multi-'omics big data analyses to generate hypotheses and make sense of their rich, diverse and ever growing datasets, to enable implementation of translational P4 medicine.},

abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic is developing worldwide with common dynamics but also with marked differences between regions and countries. These are not completely understood, but presumably, provide a clue to find ways to mitigate epidemics until strategies leading to its eradication become available. We describe an iteractive monitoring tool available in the internet. It enables inspection of the dynamic state of the epidemic in 187 countries using trajectories that visualize the transmission and removal rates of the epidemic and in this way bridge epi-curve tracking with modelling approaches. Examples were provided which characterize state of epidemic in different regions of the world in terms of fast and slow growing and decaying regimes and estimate associated rate factors. The basic spread of the disease is associated with transmission between two individuals every two-three days on the average. Non-pharmaceutical interventions decrease this value to up to ten days, whereas complete lock down measures are required to stop the epidemic. Comparison of trajectories revealed marked differences between the countries regarding efficiency of measures taken against the epidemic. Trajectories also reveal marked country-specific recovery and death rate dynamics. The results presented refer to the pandemic state in May to July 2020 and can serve as working instruction for timely monitoring using the interactive monitoring tool as a sort of seismometer for the evaluation of the state of epidemic, e.g., the possible effect of measures taken in both, lock-down and lock-up directions. Comparison of trajectories between countries and regions will support developing hypotheses and models to better understand regional differences of dynamics of Covid-19.},

abstract = {A study of genome-wide gene expression in major depressive disorder (MDD) was undertaken in a large population-based sample to determine whether altered expression levels of genes and pathways could provide insights into biological mechanisms that are relevant to this disorder. Gene expression studies have the potential to detect changes that may be because of differences in common or rare genomic sequence variation, environmental factors or their interaction. We recruited a European ancestry sample of 463 individuals with recurrent MDD and 459 controls, obtained self-report and semi-structured interview data about psychiatric and medical history and other environmental variables, sequenced RNA from whole blood and genotyped a genome-wide panel of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We used analytical methods to identify MDD-related genes and pathways using all of these sources of information. In analyses of association between MDD and expression levels of 13 857 single autosomal genes, accounting for multiple technical, physiological and environmental covariates, a significant excess of low P-values was observed, but there was no significant single-gene association after genome-wide correction. Pathway-based analyses of expression data detected significant association of MDD with increased expression of genes in the interferon $\alpha$/$\beta$ signaling pathway. This finding could not be explained by potentially confounding diseases and medications (including antidepressants) or by computationally estimated proportions of white blood cell types. Although cause-effect relationships cannot be determined from these data, the results support the hypothesis that altered immune signaling has a role in the pathogenesis, manifestation, and/or the persistence and progression of MDD.},

abstract = {The murine epidermis with its hair follicles represents an invaluable model system for tissue regeneration and stem cell research. Here we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to reveal how cellular heterogeneity of murine telogen epidermis is tuned at the transcriptional level. Unbiased clustering of 1,422 single-cell transcriptomes revealed 25 distinct populations of interfollicular and follicular epidermal cells. Our data allowed the reconstruction of gene expression programs during epidermal differentiation and along the proximal-distal axis of the hair follicle at unprecedented resolution. Moreover, transcriptional heterogeneity of the epidermis can essentially be explained along these two axes, and we show that heterogeneity in stem cell compartments generally reflects this model: stem cell populations are segregated by spatial signatures but share a common basal-epidermal gene module. This study provides an unbiased and systematic view of transcriptional organization of adult epidermis and highlights how cellular heterogeneity can be orchestrated in vivo to assure tissue homeostasis.},

Here we describe a strategy to address this problem that combines gene expression profiling of large numbers of single cells with data analysis based on diffusion maps for dimensionality reduction and network synthesis from state transition graphs. Applying the approach to hematopoietic development in the mouse embryo, we map the progression of mesoderm toward blood using single-cell gene expression analysis of 3,934 cells with blood-forming potential captured at four time points between E7.0 and E8.5. Transitions between individual cellular states are then used as input to develop a single-cell network synthesis toolkit to generate a computationally executable transcriptional regulatory network model of blood development. Several model predictions concerning the roles of Sox and Hox factors are validated experimentally. Our results demonstrate that single-cell analysis of a developing organ coupled with computational approaches can reveal the transcriptional programs that underpin organogenesis.},

abstract = {While cigarette smoking is a well-recognized cause of elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, studies on longitudinal effect of smoking cessation on WBC count are limited. We attempted to determine causal relationships between smoking and elevated WBC count by retrospective cross-sectional study consisting of 37,972 healthy Japanese adults who had a health check-up between April 1, 2008 and March 31, 2009 and longitudinal study involving 1730 current smokers who had more than four consecutive annual health check-ups between April 1, 2007 and March 31, 2012. In the cross-sectional study, younger age, male gender, increased body mass index, no alcohol habit, current smoking, and elevated C-reactive protein level were associated with elevated WBC count. Among these factors, current smoking had the most significant association with elevated WBC count. In subgroup analyses by WBC differentials, smoking was significantly associated with elevated counts of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. Ex-smoking was not associated with elevated WBC count. In the longitudinal study, both WBC and neutrophil counts decreased significantly in one year after smoking cessation and remained down-regulated for longer than next two years. There was no significant change in either WBC or neutrophil count in those who continued smoking. These findings clearly demonstrated that current smoking is strongly associated with elevated WBC count and smoking cessation leads to recovery of WBC count in one year, which is maintained for longer than subsequent two years. Thus, current smoking is a significant and reversible cause of elevated WBC count in healthy adults.},

abstract = {The association of members of the enterovirus family with pregnancy complications up to miscarriages is under discussion. Here, infection of two different human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines and iPSC-derived primary germ-layer cells with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) was characterized as an in vitro cell culture model for very early human development. Transcriptomic analysis of iPSC lines infected with recombinant CVB3 expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) revealed a reduction in the expression of pluripotency genes besides an enhancement of genes involved in RNA metabolism. The initial distribution of CVB3-EGFP-positive cells within iPSC colonies correlated with the distribution of its receptor coxsackie-and adenovirus receptor (CAR). Application of anti-CAR blocking antibodies supported the requirement of CAR, but not of the co-receptor decay-accelerating factor (DAF) for infection of iPSC lines. Among iPSC-derived germ-layer cells, mesodermal cells were especially vulnerable to CVB3-EGFP infection. Our data implicate further consideration of members of the enterovirus family in the screening program of human pregnancies. Furthermore, iPSCs with their differentiation capacity into cell populations of relevant viral target organs could offer a reliable screening approach for therapeutic intervention and for assessment of organ-specific enterovirus virulence.},

Medical applications emerged in the field of cancer, with studies of both solid tumors and hematological malignancies leading to the development of tests that are now used to personalize therapeutic options. Microarrays have also been used to analyze the blood transcriptome in a wide range of diseases. In human autoimmune diseases, these studies are showing potential for identifying therapeutic targets as well as biomarkers for diagnosis, assessment of disease activity, and response to treatment. More quantitative and sensitive high-throughput RNA profiling methods are starting to be available and will be necessary for transcriptome analyses to become routine tests in the clinical setting.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The extent to which moderate overweight (body mass index [BMI], 25.0-29.9 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]) and obesity (BMI, {\textgreater}/= 30.0) are associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) through adverse effects on blood pressure and cholesterol levels is unclear, as is the risk of CHD that remains after these mediating effects are considered. METHODS: Relative risks (RRs) of CHD associated with moderate overweight and obesity with and without adjustment for blood pressure and cholesterol concentrations were calculated by the members of a collaboration of prospective cohort studies of healthy, mainly white persons and pooled by means of random-effects models (RRs for categories of BMI in 14 cohorts and for continuous BMI in 21 cohorts; total N = 302 296). RESULTS: A total of 18 000 CHD events occurred during follow-up. The age-, sex-, physical activity-, and smoking-adjusted RRs (95{\%} confidence intervals) for moderate overweight and obesity compared with normal weight were 1.32 (1.24-1.40) and 1.81 (1.56-2.10), respectively. Additional adjustment for blood pressure and cholesterol levels reduced the RR to 1.17 (1.11-1.23) for moderate overweight and to 1.49 (1.32-1.67) for obesity. The RR associated with a 5-unit BMI increment was 1.29 (1.22-1.35) before and 1.16 (1.11-1.21) after adjustment for blood pressure and cholesterol levels. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse effects of overweight on blood pressure and cholesterol levels could account for about 45{\%} of the increased risk of CHD. Even for moderate overweight, there is a significant increased risk of CHD independent of these traditional risk factors, although confounding (eg, by dietary factors) cannot be completely ruled out.},

PARTICIPANTS: A total of 975 [corrected] men and women aged 60 to 80 years with systolic blood pressure lower than 145 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure lower than 85 mm Hg while receiving treatment with a single antihypertensive medication. SETTING: Four academic health centers. INTERVENTION: The 585 obese participants were randomized to reduced sodium intake, weight loss, both, or usual care, and the 390 nonobese participants were randomized to reduced sodium intake or usual care. Withdrawal of antihypertensive medication was attempted after 3 months of intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Diagnosis of high blood pressure at 1 or more follow-up visits, or treatment with antihypertensive medication, or a cardiovascular event during follow-up (range, 15-36 months; median, 29 months). RESULTS: The combined outcome measure was less frequent among those assigned vs not assigned to reduced sodium intake (relative hazard ratio, 0.69; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.59-0.81; P{\textless}.001) and, in obese participants, among those assigned vs not assigned to weight loss (relative hazard ratio, 0.70; 95{\%} CI, 0.57-0.87; P{\textless}.001). Relative to usual care, hazard ratios among the obese participants were 0.60 (95{\%} CI, 0.45-0.80; P{\textless}.001) for reduced sodium intake alone, 0.64 (95{\%} CI, 0.49-0.85; P=.002) for weight loss alone, and 0.47 (95{\%} CI, 0.35-0.64; P{\textless}.001) for reduced sodium intake and weight loss combined. The frequency of cardiovascular events during follow-up was similar in each of the 6 treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Reduced sodium intake and weight loss constitute a feasible, effective, and safe nonpharmacologic therapy of hypertension in older persons.},

abstract = {Summary Clinically acquired resistance to MAPK inhibitor (MAPKi) therapies for melanoma cannot be fully explained by genomic mechanisms and may be accompanied by co-evolution of intra-tumoral immunity. We sought to discover non-genomic mechanisms of acquired resistance and dynamic immune compositions by a comparative, transcriptomic-methylomic analysis of patient-matched melanoma tumors biopsied before therapy and during disease progression. Transcriptomic alterations across resistant tumors were highly recurrent, in contrast to mutations, and were frequently correlated with differential methylation of tumor cell-intrinsic CpG sites. We identified in the tumor cell compartment supra-physiologic c-MET up-expression, infra-physiologic LEF1 down-expression and YAP1 signature enrichment as drivers of acquired resistance. Importantly, high intra-tumoral cytolytic T cell inflammation prior to MAPKi therapy preceded CD8 T cell deficiency/exhaustion and loss of antigen presentation in half of disease-progressive melanomas, suggesting cross-resistance to salvage anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. Thus, melanoma acquires MAPKi resistance with highly dynamic and recurrent non-genomic alterations and co-evolving intra-tumoral immunity.},

Meta-analyses demonstrate reliable associations between psychopathology (primarily depression) and shorter telomere length, but the nature of this relationship has not been fully understood. Here, we review and evaluate the evidence for impaired telomere biology as a consequence of psychopathology or as a contributing factor, and the important mediating roles of chronic psychological stress and impaired allostasis. There is evidence for a triadic relationship among stress, telomere shortening, and psychiatric disorders that is positively reinforcing and unfolds across the life course and, possibly, across generations. We review the role of genetics and biobehavioral responses that may contribute to shorter telomere length, as well as the neurobiological impact of impaired levels of telomerase. These complex interrelationships are important to elucidate because they have implications for mental and physical comorbidity and, potentially, for the prevention and treatment of depression.},

Here we evaluate patterns of diversity across 33 phenotypes collected over a 17-year period from 580 table and wine grape accessions that belong to one of the world's largest grape gene banks, the grape germplasm collection of the United States Department of Agriculture. We find that phenological events throughout the growing season are correlated, and quantify the marked difference in size between table and wine grapes. By pairing publicly available historical phenotype data with genome-wide polymorphism data, we identify large effect loci controlling traits that have been targeted during domestication and breeding, including hermaphroditism, lighter skin pigmentation and muscat aroma. Breeding for larger berries in table grapes was traditionally concentrated in geographic regions where Islam predominates and alcohol was prohibited, whereas wine grapes retained the ancestral smaller size that is more desirable for winemaking in predominantly Christian regions. We uncover a novel locus with a suggestive association with berry size that harbors a signature of positive selection for larger berries. Our results suggest that religious rules concerning alcohol consumption have had a marked impact on patterns of phenomic and genomic diversity in grapes.},

After classifying individual cells, we generated a spatial and temporal landscape of glioma that revealed the patterns of invasion between the different sub-regions of gliomas. We also used single-cell inferred copy number variations and pseudotime trajectories to inform on the crucial branches that dominate tumor progression. The dynamic cell components of the multi-region biopsy analysis allowed us to spatially deconvolute with unprecedented accuracy the transcriptomic features of the core and those of the periphery of glioma at single-cell level. Through this rich and geographically detailed dataset, we were also able to characterize and construct the chemokine and chemokine receptor interactions that exist among different tumor and non-tumor cells. This study provides the first spatial-level analysis of the cellular states that characterize human gliomas. It also presents an initial molecular map of the cross-talks between glioma cells and the surrounding microenvironment with single-cell resolution.},

abstract = {Treatment of cancer has been revolutionized by immune checkpoint blockade therapies. Despite the high rate of response in advanced melanoma, the majority of patients succumb to disease. To identify factors associated with success or failure of checkpoint therapy, we profiled transcriptomes of 16,291 individual immune cells from 48 tumor samples of melanoma patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors. Two distinct states of CD8+ T cells were defined by clustering and associated with patient tumor regression or progression. A single transcription factor, TCF7, was visualized within CD8+ T cells in fixed tumor samples and predicted positive clinical outcome in an independent cohort of checkpoint-treated patients. We delineated the epigenetic landscape and clonality of these T cell states and demonstrated enhanced antitumor immunity by targeting novel combinations of factors in exhausted cells. Our study of immune cell transcriptomes from tumors demonstrates a strategy for identifying predictors, mechanisms, and targets for enhancing checkpoint immunotherapy. Single-cell analysis of immune cells from melanoma patients treated with immune checkpoint therapy uncovers a TCF7+ memory-like state in the cytotoxic T cell population and demonstrates its association with a positive outcome.},

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional population-based study of participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Our analytic sample included 12,142 participants, of whom 65{\%} were women, 27{\%} were non-Hispanic blacks, and 27{\%} were Mexican Americans. We report weighted geometric mean platelet counts stratified by ethnicity, sex, and age and controlled for indicators of nutritional deficiencies and inflammation. RESULTS: The lowest mean platelet counts were in whites (260 ?? 103/??L; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 256-264), and the highest were in non-Hispanic blacks (281 ?? 103/??L [95{\%} CI, 276-286]). Older men and women of each ethnicity consistently had lower platelet counts than young adults; 60- to 69-year-olds had mean counts 7 ?? 103/??L lower (p {\textless} 0.001) and 70- to 90-year-olds had counts 18 ?? 103/??L lower (p {\textless} 0.001).

abstract = {The grape is one of the earliest domesticated fruit crops and, since antiquity, it has been widely cultivated and prized for its fruit and wine. Here, we characterize genome-wide patterns of genetic variation in over 1,000 samples of the domesticated grape, Vitis vinifera subsp. vinifera, and its wild relative, V. vinifera subsp. sylvestris from the US Department of Agriculture grape germ-plasm collection. We find support for a Near East origin of vinifera and present evidence of introgression from local sylvestris as the grape moved into Europe. High levels of genetic diversity and rapid linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay have been maintained in vinifera, which is consistent with a weak domestication bottleneck followed by thousands of years of widespread vegetative propagation. The considerable genetic diversity within vinifera, however, is contained within a complex network of close pedigree relationships that has been generated by crosses among elite cultivars. We show that first-degree relationships are rare between wine and table grapes and among grapes from geographically distant regions. Our results suggest that although substantial genetic diversity has been maintained in the grape subsequent to domestication, there has been a limited exploration of this diversity. We propose that the adoption of vegetative propagation was a double-edged sword: Although it provided a benefit by ensuring true breeding cultivars, it also discouraged the generation of unique cultivars through crosses. The grape currently faces severe pathogen pressures, and the long-term sustainability of the grape and wine industries will rely on the exploitation of the grape's tremendous natural genetic diversity.},

To identify downstream effectors of MAPK signaling that could be used as potential additional therapeutic targets for BRAF V600E inhibitors, we used hTERT/CDK4R24C/p53DD-immortalized primary human melanocytes genetically modified to ectopically express BRAF V600E or NRASG12D and observed induction of the AP-1 transcription factor family member c-Jun. Using a dominant negative approach, in vitro cell proliferation assays, western blots, and flow cytometry showed that MAPK signaling via BRAFV600E promotes melanoma cell proliferation at G1 through AP-1-mediated negative regulation of the INK4 family member, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2C (CDKN2C), and the CIP/KIP family member, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A). These effects were antagonized by pharmacological inhibition of CDKN2C and CDKN1A targets CDK2 and CDK4 in vitro. In contrast to BRAFV600E or NRASG12D-expressing melanocytes, melanoma cells have an inherent resistance to suppression of AP-1 activity by BRAFV600E- or MEK-inhibitors. Here, CDK2/4 inhibition statistically significantly augmented the effects of BRAFV600E- or MEK-inhibitors on melanoma cell viability in vitro and growth in athymic nude Foxn1nu mice (P . 03 when mean tumor volume at day 13 was compared for BRAFV600E inhibitor vs BRAFV600E inhibitor plus CDK2/4 inhibition; P . 02 when mean tumor volume was compared for MEK inhibitor vs MEK inhibitor plus CDK2/4 inhibition; P values were calculated by a two-sided Welch t test; n 4-8 mice per group). {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author 2012.},

abstract = {Background: Cancer treatments have substantially improved childhood cancer survival but are accompanied by long-term complications, notably chronic inflammatory diseases. We hypothesize that cancer treatments could lead to long-term epigenetic changes in immune cells, resulting in increased prevalence of inflammatory diseases in cancer survivors. Results: To test this hypothesis, we established the epigenetic and transcriptomic profiles of immune cells from 44 childhood cancer survivors (CCS, {\textgreater} 16 years old) on full remission ({\textgreater} 5 years) who had received chemotherapy alone or in combination with total body irradiation (TBI) and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). We found that more than 10 years post-treatment, CCS treated with TBI/HSCT showed an altered DNA methylation signature in T cell, particularly at genes controlling immune and inflammatory processes and oxidative stress. DNA methylation remodeling in T cell was partially associated with chronic expression changes of nearby genes, increased frequency of type 1 cytokine-producing T cell, elevated systemic levels of these cytokines, and over-activation of related signaling pathways. Survivors exposed to TBI/HSCT were further characterized by an Epigenetic-Aging-Signature of T cell consistent with accelerated epigenetic aging. To investigate the potential contribution of irradiation to these changes, we established two cell culture models. We identified that radiation partially recapitulated the immune changes observed in survivors through a bystander effect that could be mediated by circulating factors. Conclusion: Cancer treatments, in particular TBI/HSCT, are associated with long-term immune disturbances. We propose that epigenetic remodeling of immune cells following cancer therapy augments inflammatory- and age-related diseases, including metabolic complications, in childhood cancer survivors.},

abstract = {Cutaneous melanoma causes 55 500 deaths annually. The incidence and mortality rates of the disease differ widely across the globe depending on access to early detection and primary care. Once melanoma has spread, this type of cancer rapidly becomes life-threatening. For more than 40 years, few treatment options were available, and clinical trials during that time were all unsuccessful. Over the past 10 years, increased biological understanding and access to innovative therapeutic substances have transformed advanced melanoma into a new oncological model for treating solid cancers. Treatments that target B-Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine-kinase (BRAF)V600 (Val600) mutations using selected BRAF inhibitors combined with mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors have significantly improved response and overall survival. Furthermore, advanced cutaneous melanoma has developed into a prototype for testing checkpoint-modulating agents, which has increased hope for long-term tumour containment and a potential cure. These expectations have been sustained by clinical success with targeted agents and antibodies that block programmed cell-death protein 1 in locoregional disease, which induces prolongation of relapse-free, distant-metastasis-free, and overall survival times.},

Here we present a pipeline for the complete genomic and transcriptomic re-annotation of Illumina probe sequences, also applicable to other platforms, with its output available through a Web interface and incorporated into Bioconductor packages. We have identified several problems with the design of individual probes and we show the benefits of probe re-annotation on the analysis of BeadArray gene expression data sets. We discuss the importance of aspects such as probe coverage of individual transcripts, alternative messenger RNA splicing, single-nucleotide polymorphisms, repeat sequences, RNA degradation biases and probes targeting genomic regions with no known transcription. We conclude that many of the Illumina probes have unreliable original annotation and that our re-annotation allows analyses to focus on the good quality probes, which form the majority, and also to expand the scope of biological information that can be extracted.},

Systematic molecular analysis of stem cell behavior is challenging because classic approaches cannot resolve cellular heterogeneity or capture developmental dynamics.

We further developed Waterfall, a bioinformatic pipeline, to statistically quantify singe-cell gene expression along a de novo reconstructed continuous developmental trajectory. Our study reveals molecular signatures of adult qNSCs, characterized by active niche signaling integration and low protein translation capacity. Our analyses further delineate molecular cascades underlying qNSC activation and neurogenesis initiation, exemplified by decreased extrinsic signaling capacity, primed translational machinery, and regulatory switches in transcription factors, metabolism, and energy sources. Our study reveals the molecular continuum underlying adult neurogenesis and illustrates how Waterfall can be used for single-cell omics analyses of various continuous biological processes.},

However, few data are available on the specific types of medication associated with obesity and physical inactivity. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the independent association of body mass index (BMI) and physical inactivity with use of specific classes of prescription drugs, and the interaction between BMI and physical inactivity. Methods: The Doetinchem Cohort Study is a population-based longitudinal study. We analyzed cross-sectional data of 1703 men and 1841 women, examined between 1998 and 2002, for whom drug-dispending data were available from the PHARMO database. Drugs were coded according to the WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. Body weight was measured during the physical examination. Physical activity was assessed using an extensive questionnaire. Persons were defined as a user of a certain drug class if they filed at least one prescription in the year around (+/-6 months) the examination. Results: Compared with normal weight persons (BMI 18.5-25 kg m(-2)), obese persons (BMI {\textgreater} 30 kg m(-2)) had a higher use of prescription drugs of several drug classes, especially cardiovascular drugs (OR (95{\%} CI): 3.83 (2.61-5.64) in men and 2.80 (2.03-3.86) in women) and diabetes drugs (OR (95{\%} CI): 5.72 (2.32-14.14) in men and 3.92 (1.80-8.54) in women). In women, physical inactivity was also associated with higher use of certain drug classes, such as drugs for blood and blood-forming organs (OR (95{\%} CI): 2.11 (1.22-3.65)) and musculoskeletal drugs (OR (95{\%} CI): 2.07 (1.45-2.97)), whereas in men this was not the case. We found no interaction between BMI and physical inactivity with respect to use of prescription drugs. Conclusion: In both men and women, obesity was associated with a higher use of several types of prescription drugs, whereas physical inactivity was only associated with a higher use of certain drug classes in women.

abstract = {Benzene, a ubiquitous environmental pollutant, causes acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Recently, through transcriptome profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), we reported dose-dependent effects of benzene exposure on gene expression and biochemical pathways in 83 workers exposed across four airborne concentration ranges (from {\textless}1 ppm to {\textgreater}10 ppm) compared with 42 subjects with non-workplace ambient exposure levels. Here, we further characterize these dose-dependent effects with continuous benzene exposure in all 125 study subjects. We estimated air benzene exposure levels in the 42 environmentally-exposed subjects from their unmetabolized urinary benzene levels. We used a novel non-parametric, data-adaptive model selection method to estimate the change with dose in the expression of each gene. We describe non-parametric approaches to model pathway responses and used these to estimate the dose responses of the AML pathway and 4 other pathways of interest. The response patterns of majority of genes as captured by mean estimates of the first and second principal components of the dose-response for the five pathways and the profiles of 6 AML pathway response-representative genes (identified by clustering) exhibited similar apparent supra-linear responses. Responses at or below 0.1 ppm benzene were observed for altered expression of AML pathway genes and CYP2E1. Together, these data show that benzene alters disease-relevant pathways and genes in a dose-dependent manner, with effects apparent at doses as low as 100 ppb in air. Studies with extensive exposure assessment of subjects exposed in the low-dose range between 10 ppb and 1 ppm are needed to confirm these findings.},

We present an analysis pipeline based on SOM machine learning which allows the comprehensive study of large scale clinical data. The potency of the method is demonstrated in selected applications studying the diversity of gene expression in Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) and prostate cancer progression. Our method characterizes relationships between the samples, disentangles the expression patterns into well separated groups of co-regulated genes, extracts their functional contexts using enrichment techniques, and enables the detection of contaminations and outliers in the samples. We found that the four GBM subtypes can be divided into two "localized" and two "intermediate" ones. The localized subtypes are characterized by the antagonistic activation of processes related to immune response and cell division, commonly observed also in other cancers. In contrast, each of the "intermediate" subtypes forms a heterogeneous continuum of expression states linking the "localized" subtypes. Both "intermediate" subtypes are characterized by distinct expression patterns related to translational activity and innate immunity as well as nervous tissue and cell function. We show that SOM portraits provide a comprehensive framework for the description of the diversity of expression landscapes using concepts of molecular function. {\textcopyright} 2013 Landes Bioscience.},

The procedure consists of starting with k groups which each consist of a single random point, and thereafter adding the points one after another to the group whose mean each point is nearest. After a point is added to a group, the mean of that group is adjusted so as to take account of the new point. Thus at each stage there are in fact k means, one for each group. After the sample is processed in this way, the points are classified on the basis of nearness to the final means. The portions which result tend to be fficient in the sense of having low within class variance. Applications are suggested for the problems of non-linear prediction, efficient communication, non-parametric tests of independence, similarity grouping, and automatic file construction. The extension of the methods to general metric spaces is indicated.},

abstract = {Cancer cells possess traits reminiscent of those ascribed to normal stem cells. It is unclear, however, whether these phenotypic similarities reflect the activity of common molecular pathways. Here, we analyze the enrichment patterns of gene sets associated with embryonic stem (ES) cell identity in the expression profiles of various human tumor types. We find that histologically poorly differentiated tumors show preferential overexpression of genes normally enriched in ES cells, combined with preferential repression of Polycomb-regulated genes. Moreover, activation targets of Nanog, Oct4, Sox2 and c-Myc are more frequently overexpressed in poorly differentiated tumors than in well-differentiated tumors. In breast cancers, this ES-like signature is associated with high-grade estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors, often of the basal-like subtype, and with poor clinical outcome. The ES signature is also present in poorly differentiated glioblastomas and bladder carcinomas. We identify a subset of ES cell-associated transcription regulators that are highly expressed in poorly differentiated tumors. Our results reveal a previously unknown link between genes associated with ES cell identity and the histopathological traits of tumors and support the possibility that these genes contribute to stem cell-like phenotypes shown by many tumors. {\textcopyright} 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Consistent with global trends, the prevalence of obesity is increasing among Norwegian adults. This study aimed to investigate individual trends in BMI (kg/m2) by age, gender, and socio-economic status over an 11-year period. METHODS: A cohort of 1169 adults (n=581 men; n=588 women) self-reported BMI during a general health interview twice administered in two regions in Norway. RESULTS: Average BMI increased significantly from 23.7 (SD = 3.4) to 25.4 (SD = 3.8), with equivalent increases for both genders. Proportion of obesity (BMI {\textgreater} 30) increased from 4{\%} to 11{\%} for women and 5{\%} to 13{\%} for men. Of those already classified as overweight or obese in 1990, 68{\%} had gained additional weight 10 years later, by an average increase of 2.6 BMI units. The greatest amount of weight gain occurred for the youngest adults (aged 20-29 years). Age-adjusted general linear models revealed that in 1990, women with a lower level of education had a significantly greater BMI than more educated women. In both 1990 and 2001, rural men with the highest level of household income had a greater BMI than rural men earning less income. No significant associations were found between SES and changes in BMI over time. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrated significant yet gender-equivalent increases in BMI over an 11-year period within this cohort of Norwegian adults. Whereas socio-economic status exerted minimal influence on changes in BMI over time, young adulthood appeared to be a critical time period at which accelerated weight gain occurred.},

abstract = {Cancer is a heterogeneous and complex disease. Tumors are formed by cancer cells and a myriad of non-cancerous cell types that together with the extracellular matrix form the tumor microenvironment. These cancer-associated cells and components contribute to shape the progression of cancer and are deeply involved in patient outcome. The immune system is an essential part of the tumor microenvironment, and induction of cancer immunotolerance is a necessary step involved in tumor formation and growth. Immune mechanisms are intimately associated with cancer progression, invasion, and metastasis; as well as to tumor dormancy and modulation of sensitivity to drug therapy. Transcriptome analyses have been extensively used to understand the heterogeneity of tumors, classifying tumors into molecular subtypes and establishing signatures that predict response to therapy and patient outcomes. However, the classification of the tumor cell diversity and specially the identification of rare populations has been limited in these transcriptomic analyses of bulk tumor cell populations. Massively-parallel single-cell RNAseq analysis has emerged as a powerful method to unravel heterogeneity and to study rare cell populations in cancer, through unsupervised sampling and modeling of transcriptional states in single cells. In this context, the study of the role of the immune system in cancer would benefit from single cell approaches, as it will enable the characterization and/or discovery of the cell types and pathways involved in cancer immunotolerance otherwise missed in bulk transcriptomic information. Thus, the analysis of gene expression patterns at single cell resolution holds the potential to provide key information to develop precise and personalized cancer treatment including immunotherapy. This review is focused on the latest single-cell RNAseq methodologies able to agnostically study thousands of tumor cells as well as targeted single-cell RNAseq to study rare populations within tumors. In particular, we will discuss methods to study the immune system in cancer. We will also discuss the current challenges to the study of cancer at the single cell level and the potential solutions to the current approaches.},

This lineage was first identified in May 2021 and evolved from C.1, one of the lineages that dominated the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in South Africa and was last detected in January 2021. C.1.2 has since been detected across the majority of the provinces in South Africa and in seven other countries spanning Africa, Europe, Asia and Oceania. The emergence of C.1.2 was associated with an increased substitution rate, as was previously observed with the emergence of the Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants of concern (VOCs). C.1.2 contains multiple substitutions (R190S, D215G, N484K, N501Y, H655Y and T859N) and deletions (Y144del, L242-A243del) within the spike protein, which have been observed in other VOCs and are associated with increased transmissibility and reduced neutralization sensitivity. Of greater concern is the accumulation of additional mutations (C136F, Y449H and N679K) which are also likely to impact neutralization sensitivity or furin cleavage and therefore replicative fitness. While the phenotypic characteristics and epidemiology of C.1.2 are being defined, it is important to highlight this lineage given its concerning constellations of mutations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe Network for Genomic Surveillance South Africa (NGS-SA) is supported by the Strategic Health Innovation Partnerships Unit of the South African Medical Research Council, with funds received from the South African Department of Science and Innovation.

abstract = {Background: The blood transcriptome is expected to provide a detailed picture of organism's physiological state with potential impact for applications in medical diagnostics and molecular and epidemiological research. We here present the analysis of blood specimen of 3,388 adult individuals, together with phenotype characteristics such as disease history, medication status, lifestyle factors and body mass index (BMI). The size and heterogeneity of this data challenges analytics in terms of dimension reduction, knowledge mining, feature extraction and data integration. Methods: Self Organizing Maps (SOM)-machine learning was applied to study transcriptional states on a population-wide scale. The method permits a detailed description and visualization of the molecular heterogeneity of transcriptomes and of their association with different phenotypic features. Results: The diversity of transcriptomes is described by personalized SOM-portraits, which specify the samples in terms of modules of co-expressed genes of different functional context. We identify two major blood transcriptome types where type 1 accumulates more men, elderly and overweight people and it upregulates genes associating with inflammation and increased heme metabolism, while type 2 accumulates women, younger and normal weight participants and it associates with activated immune response, transcriptional, ribosomal, mitochondrial and telomere-maintenance cell-functions. We find a striking overlap of signatures shared by multiple diseases, ageing and obesity driven by an underlying common pattern, which associates with immune response and the increase of inflammatory processes. Conclusions: Machine learning application to large and heterogeneous omics data provides a holistic view on the diversity of the human blood transcriptome. It provides a tool for comparative analyses of transcriptional signatures and of associated phenotypes in population studies and medical applications.},

Here we demonstrate that data from a single high-throughput DNase I hypersensitivity assay can delineate hundreds of thousands of base-pair resolution in vivo footprints in human cells that precisely mark individual transcription factor-DNA interactions. These annotations provide a unique resource for the investigation of cis-regulatory elements. We find that footprints for specific transcription factors correlate with ChIP-seq enrichment and can accurately identify functional versus nonfunctional transcription factor motifs. We also find that footprints reveal a unique evolutionary conservation pattern that differentiates functional footprinted bases from surrounding DNA. Finally, detailed analysis of CTCF footprints suggests multiple modes of binding and a novel DNA binding motif upstream of the primary binding site. {\textcopyright} 2011 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {Background: A fundamental fact in biology states that genes do not operate in isolation, and yet, methods that infer regulatory networks for single cell gene expression data have been slow to emerge. With single cell sequencing methods now becoming accessible, general network inference algorithms that were initially developed for data collected from bulk samples may not be suitable for single cells. Meanwhile, although methods that are specific for single cell data are now emerging, whether they have improved performance over general methods is unknown. In this study, we evaluate the applicability of five general methods and three single cell methods for inferring gene regulatory networks from both experimental single cell gene expression data and in silico simulated data. Results: Standard evaluation metrics using ROC curves and Precision-Recall curves against reference sets sourced from the literature demonstrated that most of the methods performed poorly when they were applied to either experimental single cell data, or simulated single cell data, which demonstrates their lack of performance for this task. Using default settings, network methods were applied to the same datasets. Comparisons of the learned networks highlighted the uniqueness of some predicted edges for each method. The fact that different methods infer networks that vary substantially reflects the underlying mathematical rationale and assumptions that distinguish network methods from each other. Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of network modeling algorithms applied to experimental single cell gene expression data and in silico simulated datasets where the network structure is known. Comparisons demonstrate that most of these assessed network methods are not able to predict network structures from single cell expression data accurately, even if they are specifically developed for single cell methods. Also, single cell methods, which usually depend on more elaborative algorithms, in general have less similarity to each other in the sets of edges detected. The results from this study emphasize the importance for developing more accurate optimized network modeling methods that are compatible for single cell data. Newly-developed single cell methods may uniquely capture particular features of potential gene-gene relationships, and caution should be taken when we interpret these results.},

abstract = {Humans differ from other primates by marked differences in cognitive abilities and a significantly larger brain. These differences correlate with metabolic changes, as evidenced by the relative up-regulation of energy-related genes and metabolites in human brain. While the mechanisms underlying these evolutionary changes have not been elucidated, altered activities of key transcription factors (TFs) could play a pivotal role. To assess this possibility, we analyzed microarray data from five tissues from humans and chimpanzees. We identified 90 TF genes with significantly different expression levels in human and chimpanzee brain among which the rapidly evolving KRAB-zinc finger genes are markedly over-represented. The differentially expressed TFs cluster within a robust regulatory network consisting of two distinct but interlinked modules, one strongly associated with energy metabolism functions, and the other with transcription, vesicular transport, and ubiquitination. Our results suggest that concerted changes in a relatively small number of interacting TFs may coordinate major gene expression differences in human and chimpanzee brain.},

abstract = {Background The newly described SARS-CoV-2 lineage C.37 was recently classified as a variant of interest by the WHO (Lambda variant) based on its high circulation rates in South American countries and the presence of critical mutations in the spike protein. The impact of such mutations in infectivity and immune escape from neutralizing antibodies are entirely unknown.

Methods We performed a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay and determined the impact of the Lambda variant on infectivity and immune escape using plasma samples from healthcare workers (HCW) from two centers in Santiago, Chile who received the two-doses scheme of the inactivated virus vaccine CoronaVac.

Results We observed an increased infectivity mediated by the Lambda spike protein that was even higher than that of the D614G (lineage B) or the Alpha and Gamma variants. Compared to the Wild type (lineage A), neutralization was decreased by 3.05-fold for the Lambda variant while it was 2.33-fold for the Gamma variant and 2.03-fold for the Alpha variant.

Conclusions Our results indicate that mutations present in the spike protein of the Lambda variant of interest confer increased infectivity and immune escape from neutralizing antibodies elicited by CoronaVac. These data reinforce the idea that massive vaccination campaigns in countries with high SARS-CoV-2 circulation must be accompanied by strict genomic surveillance allowing the identification of new isolates carrying spike mutations and immunology studies aimed to determine the impact of these mutations in immune escape and vaccines breakthrough.

Most known regulatory mechanisms target TLR signalling pathways and thus broadly inhibit multiple aspects of the inflammatory response. Given the functional diversity of TLR-induced genes, we proposed that additional, gene-specific regulatory mechanisms exist to allow individual aspects of the TLR-induced response to be differentially regulated. Using an in vitro system of lipopolysaccharide tolerance in murine macrophages, we show that TLR-induced genes fall into two categories on the basis of their functions and regulatory requirements. We demonstrate that representatives from the two classes acquire distinct patterns of TLR-induced chromatin modifications. These gene-specific chromatin modifications are associated with transient silencing of one class of genes, which includes pro-inflammatory mediators, and priming of the second class, which includes antimicrobial effectors. These findings illustrate an adaptive response in macrophages and reveal component-specific regulation of inflammation. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototype systemic autoimmune disease characterized by flares of high morbidity. Using oligonucleotide microarrays, we now show that active SLE can be distinguished by a remarkably homogeneous gene expression pattern with overexpression of granulopoiesis-related and interferon (IFN)-induced genes. Using the most stringent statistical analysis (Bonferroni correction), 15 genes were found highly up-regulated in SLE patients, 14 of which are targets of IFN and one, defensin DEFA-3, a major product of immature granulocytes. A more liberal correction (Benjamini and Hochberg correction) yielded 18 additional genes, 12 of which are IFN-regulated and 4 granulocyte-specific. Indeed immature neutrophils were identified in a large fraction of SLE patients white blood cells. High dose glucocorticoids, a standard treatment of disease flares, shuts down the interferon signature, further supporting the role of this cytokine in SLE. The expression of 10 genes correlated with disease activity according to the SLEDAI. The most striking correlation (P {\textless} 0.001, r = 0.55) was found with the formyl peptide receptor-like 1 protein that mediates chemotactic activities of defensins. Therefore, while the IFN signature confirms the central role of this cytokine in SLE, microarray analysis of blood cells reveals that immature granulocytes may be involved in SLE pathogenesis.},

abstract = {A mechanistic understanding of robust self-assembly and repair capabilities of complex systems would have enormous implications for basic evolutionary developmental biology as well as for transformative applications in regenerative biomedicine and the engineering of highly fault-tolerant cybernetic systems. Molecular biologists are working to identify the pathways underlying the remarkable regenerative abilities of model species that perfectly regenerate limbs, brains, and other complex body parts. However, a profound disconnect remains between the deluge of high-resolution genetic and protein data on pathways required for regeneration, and the desired spatial, algorithmic models that show how self-monitoring and growth control arise from the synthesis of cellular activities. This barrier to progress in the understanding of morphogenetic controls may be breached by powerful techniques from the computational sciences-using non-traditional modeling approaches to reverse-engineer systems such as planaria: flatworms with a complex bodyplan and nervous system that are able to regenerate any body part after traumatic injury. Currently, the involvement of experts from outside of molecular genetics is hampered by the specialist literature of molecular developmental biology: impactful collaborations across such different fields require that review literature be available that presents the key functional capabilities of important biological model systems while abstracting away from the often irrelevant and confusing details of specific genes and proteins. To facilitate modeling efforts by computer scientists, physicists, engineers, and mathematicians, we present a different kind of review of planarian regeneration. Focusing on the main patterning properties of this system, we review what is known about the signal exchanges that occur during regenerative repair in planaria and the cellular mechanisms that are thought to underlie them. By establishing an engineering-like style for reviews of the molecular developmental biology of biomedically important model systems, significant fresh insights and quantitative computational models will be developed by new collaborations between biology and the information sciences. {\textcopyright} 2012 Lobo et al.},

The profiles classify macrophages derived from CBA/Ca mice as M1-like (pro-inflammatory) and those from C57BL/6 mice as M2-like (anti-inflammatory); measurements of NOS2 and arginase activity in normal bone marrow macrophages confirm these findings. After irradiation in vivo, but not in vitro, C57BL/6 macrophages show a reduction in NOS2 and an increase in arginase activities, indicating a further M2 response, whereas CBA/Ca macrophages retain an M1 phenotype. Activation of specific signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathways in irradiated hemopoietic tissues supports these observations. The data indicate that macrophage activation is not a direct effect of radiation but a tissue response, secondary to the initial radiation exposure, and have important implications for understanding genotype-dependent responses and the mechanisms of the hemotoxic and leukemogenic consequences of radiation exposure. {\textcopyright}2008 American Association for Cancer Research.},

abstract = {Objective: Cellular heterogeneity is regarded as a major factor affecting treatment response and resistance in malignant melanoma. Recent developments in single-cell sequencing technology have provided deeper insights into these mechanisms. Methods: Here, we analyzed a BRAFV600E-mutant melanoma cell line by single-cell RNA-seq under various conditions: cells sensitive to BRAF inhibition with BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and cells resistant to BRAF inhibition with vemurafenib alone or vemurafenib in combination with the MEK1/2 inhibitors cobimetinib or trametinib. Dimensionality reduction by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and self-organizing maps identified distinct trajectories of resistance development clearly separating the 4 treatment conditions in cell and gene state space. Results: Trajectories associated with resistance to single-agent treatment involved cell cycle, extracellular matrix, and de-differentiation programs. In contrast, shifts detected in double-resistant cells primarily affected translation and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway reactivation, with a small subpopulation showing markers of pluripotency. These findings were validated in pseudotime analyses and RNA velocity measurements. Conclusions: The single-cell transcriptomic analyses reported here employed a spectrum of bioinformatics methods to identify mechanisms of melanoma resistance to single- and double-agent treatments. This study deepens our understanding of treatmentinduced cellular reprogramming and plasticity in melanoma cells and identifies targets of potential relevance to the management of treatment resistance.},

Here, we present a computational doublet detection tool—DoubletFinder—that identifies doublets using only gene expression data. DoubletFinder predicts doublets according to each real cell's proximity in gene expression space to artificial doublets created by averaging the transcriptional profile of randomly chosen cell pairs. We first use scRNA-seq datasets where the identity of doublets is known to show that DoubletFinder identifies doublets formed from transcriptionally distinct cells. When these doublets are removed, the identification of differentially expressed genes is enhanced. Second, we provide a method for estimating DoubletFinder input parameters, allowing its application across scRNA-seq datasets with diverse distributions of cell types. Lastly, we present “best practices” for DoubletFinder applications and illustrate that DoubletFinder is insensitive to an experimentally validated kidney cell type with “hybrid” expression features.},

abstract = {Background: Melanoma is a heterogeneous tumour, but the impact of this heterogeneity upon therapeutic response is not well understood. Methods: Single cell mRNA analysis was used to define the transcriptional heterogeneity of melanoma and its dynamic response to BRAF inhibitor therapy and treatment holidays. Discrete transcriptional states were defined in cell lines and melanoma patient specimens that predicted initial sensitivity to BRAF inhibition and the potential for effective re-challenge following resistance. A mathematical model was developed to maintain competition between the drug-sensitive and resistant states, which was validated in vivo. Findings: Our analyses showed melanoma cell lines and patient specimens to be composed of {\textgreater}3 transcriptionally distinct states. The cell state composition was dynamically regulated in response to BRAF inhibitor therapy and drug holidays. Transcriptional state composition predicted for therapy response. The differences in fitness between the different transcriptional states were leveraged to develop a mathematical model that optimized therapy schedules to retain the drug sensitive population. In vivo validation demonstrated that the personalized adaptive dosing schedules outperformed continuous or fixed intermittent BRAF inhibitor schedules. Interpretation: Our study provides the first evidence that transcriptional heterogeneity at the single cell level predicts for initial BRAF inhibitor sensitivity. We further demonstrate that manipulating transcriptional heterogeneity through personalized adaptive therapy schedules can delay the time to resistance.

abstract = {Background: Chronic low-grade inflammation is considered a driver of many age-related disorders, including vascular diseases (inflammaging). Inhibition of autophagic capacity with ageing was postulated to generate a pro-inflammatory condition via activation of inflammasomes, a group of Interleukin-1 activating intracellular multi-protein complexes. We thus investigated gene expression of inflammasome components in PBMC of 77 vascular patients (age 22-82) in association with age. Findings: Linear regression of real-time qRT-PCR data revealed a significant positive association of gene expression of each of the inflammasome components with age (Pearson correlation coefficients: AIM2: r = 0.245; P = 0.032; NLRP3: r = 0.367; P = 0.001; ASC (PYCARD): r = 0.252; P = 0.027; CASP1: r = 0.296; P = 0.009; CASP5: r = 0.453; P = 0.00003; IL1B: r = 0.247; P = 0.030). No difference in gene expression of AIM2, NLRP3, ASC CASP1, and CASP5 was detected between PBMC of patients with advanced atherosclerosis and other vascular patients, whereas IL1B expression was increased in PBMC of the latter group (P = 0.0005). Conclusion: The findings reinforce the systemic pro-inflammatory phenotype reported in elderly by demonstrating an increased phase-1 activation of inflammasomes in PBMC of vascular patients.},

abstract = {Malignant transformation can result in melanoma cells that resemble different stages of their embryonic development. Our gene expression analysis of human melanoma cell lines and patient tumors revealed that melanoma follows a two-dimensional differentiation trajectory that can be subclassified into four progressive subtypes. This differentiation model is associated with subtype-specific sensitivity to iron-dependent oxidative stress and cell death known as ferroptosis. Receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated resistance to mitogen-activated protein kinase targeted therapies and activation of the inflammatory signaling associated with immune therapy involves transitions along this differentiation trajectory, which lead to increased sensitivity to ferroptosis. Therefore, ferroptosis-inducing drugs present an orthogonal therapeutic approach to target the differentiation plasticity of melanoma cells to increase the efficacy of targeted and immune therapies. Tsoi et al. show that melanoma can be categorized into four subtypes following a differentiation trajectory with subtype-specific sensitivity to ferroptosis induction, which presents a therapeutic approach to target the differentiation plasticity to increase the efficacy of targeted and immune therapies.},

abstract = {Regular exercise offers protection against all-cause mortality, primarily by protection against cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. The latter disorders have been associated with chronic low-grade systemic inflammation reflected by a two- to threefold elevated level of several cytokines. Adipose tissue contributes to the production of TNF-alpha, which is reflected by elevated levels of soluble TNF-alpha receptors, IL-6, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and C-reactive protein. We suggest that TNF-alpha rather than IL-6 is the driver behind insulin resistance and dyslipidemia and that IL-6 is a marker of the metabolic syndrome, rather than a cause. During exercise, IL-6 is produced by muscle fibers via a TNF-independent pathway. IL-6 stimulates the appearance in the circulation of other anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1ra and IL-10 and inhibits the production of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha. In addition, IL-6 enhances lipid turnover, stimulating lipolysis as well as fat oxidation. We suggest that regular exercise induces suppression of TNF-alpha and thereby offers protection against TNF-alpha-induced insulin resistance. Recently, IL-6 was introduced as the first myokine, defined as a cytokine that is produced and released by contracting skeletal muscle fibers, exerting its effects in other organs of the body. Here we suggest that myokines may be involved in mediating the health-beneficial effects of exercise and that these in particular are involved in the protection against chronic diseases associated with low-grade inflammation such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.},

Using 30-channel mass cytometry data, we show that Wishbone accurately recovers the known stages of T-cell development in the mouse thymus, including the bifurcation point. We also apply the algorithm to mouse myeloid differentiation and demonstrate its generalization to additional lineages.

abstract = {Non-persistent viruses classically cause transient, acute infections triggering immune responses aimed at the elimination of the pathogen. Successful viruses evolved strategies to manipulate and evade these anti-viral defenses. Symptoms during the acute phase are often linked to dysregulated immune responses that disappear once the patient recovers. In some patients, however, symptoms persist or new symptoms emerge beyond the acute phase. Conditions resulting from previous transient infection are termed post-acute sequelae (PAS) and were reported for a wide range of non-persistent viruses such as rota-, influenza-or polioviruses. Here we provide an overview of non-persistent viral pathogens reported to be associated with diverse PAS, among them chronic fatigue, auto-immune disorders, or neurological complications and highlight known mechanistic details. Recently, the emergence of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) or long COVID highlighted the impact of PAS. Notably, PAS of non-persistent infections often resemble symptoms of persistent viral infections, defined by chronic inflammation. Inflammation maintained after the acute phase may be a key driver of PAS of non-persistent viruses. Therefore, we explore current insights into aberrant activation of innate immune signaling pathways in the post-acute phase of non-persistent viruses. Finally, conclusions are drawn and future perspectives for treatment and prevention of PAS are discussed.},

A subset of plastic cell lines, which followed a trajectory covering multiple known cell state transitions, provided models for more detailed biophysical investigations. Markovmodeling revealed that the cell state transitions were reversible and mediated by both Lamarckian induction and nongenetic Darwinian selection of drug-tolerant states. Single-cell functional proteomics revealed activation of certain signaling networks shortly after BRAF inhibition, and before the appearance of drug-resistant phenotypes. Drug targeting those networks, in combination with BRAF inhibition, halted the adaptive transition and led to prolonged growth inhibition in multiple patient-derived cell lines.},

We discovered that although treatment-relapsed tumors remained genetically stable, they converged on a shared resistance phenotype characterized by dramatic changes in tumor cell differentiation state, immune infiltration, and extracellular matrix (ECM) composition. Similar alterations in tumor cell differentiation were also observed in more than half of our treatment-relapsed patient tumors. Tumor cell-state changes were coincident with ECM remodeling and increased tumor stiffness, which alone was sufficient to alter tumor cell fate and reduce treatment responses in melanoma cell lines in vitro. Despite the absence of acquired mutations in the targeted pathway, resistant tumors showed significantly decreased responsiveness to second-line therapy intervention within the same pathway. The ability to preclinically model relapse and refractory settings—while capturing dynamics within and crosstalk between all relevant tumor compartments—provides a unique opportunity to better design and sequence appropriate clinical interventions.},

abstract = {Background: Recently, it was shown that fat tissue produces and releases inflammatory cytokines, and that obesity may be regarded as a state of low-grade inflammation. In this regard, we aimed to establish an association between obesity and persistent leukocytosis. Patients and methods: We present clinical observations of obese subjects primarily referred for further evaluation of leukocytosis without a cause and validated the link between leukocytosis and elevated body mass index (BMI) in a cross-sectional study. Results: During 1999-2005, 327 patients were referred for further investigation because of persistent leukocytosis. Of these, 15.3{\%} were asymptomatic obese, mostly females, with mild persistent neutrophilia accompanied by elevated acute-phase reactants. After careful evaluation, no recognized cause for leukocytosis was found other than the fact that the patients were obese. During a mean follow-up of 45.6 months, the leukocytosis and the elevated acute-phase reactants persisted and no new causes for leukocytosis were evident. Furthermore, in a cross-sectional analysis of 3716 non-smoker subjects, 62 were found to have leukocytosis. Compared with the population with a normal white blood count range, these subjects with leukocytosis had higher BMI, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, waist circumference, and neutrophil and platelet count (all P {\textless} 0.0005). After logistic regression analysis, only BMI was shown to be associated with leukocytosis (P {\textless} 0.0005). Conclusions: Obesity is recognized as a possible cause for reactive leukocytosis. Awareness of this 'obesity-associated leukocytosis' may help the clinician to avoid more extensive and unnecessary diagnostic work-up, particularly in similar obese subjects. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors.},

abstract = {Background: Long-term space travel simulation experiments enabled to discover different aspects of human metabolism such as the complexity of NaCl salt balance. Detailed proteomics data were collected during the Mars105 isolation experiment enabling a deeper insight into the molecular processes involved. Results: We studied the abundance of about two thousand proteins extracted from urine samples of six volunteers collected weekly during a 105-day isolation experiment under controlled dietary conditions including progressive reduction of salt consumption. Machine learning using Self Organizing maps (SOM) in combination with different analysis tools was applied to describe the time trajectories of protein abundance in urine. The method enables a personalized and intuitive view on the physiological state of the volunteers. The abundance of more than one half of the proteins measured clearly changes in the course of the experiment. The trajectory splits roughly into three time ranges, an early (week 1-6), an intermediate (week 7-11) and a late one (week 12-15). Regulatory modes associated with distinct biological processes were identified using previous knowledge by applying enrichment and pathway flow analysis. Early protein activation modes can be related to immune response and inflammatory processes, activation at intermediate times to developmental and proliferative processes and late activations to stress and responses to chemicals. Conclusions: The protein abundance profiles support previous results about alternative mechanisms of salt storage in an osmotically inactive form. We hypothesize that reduced NaCl consumption of about 6 g/day presumably will reduce or even prevent the activation of inflammatory processes observed in the early time range of isolation. SOM machine learning in combination with analysis methods of class discovery and functional annotation enable the straightforward analysis of complex proteomics data sets generated by means of mass spectrometry.},

abstract = {Multiple pathways are responsible for transducing mechanical and hormonal stimuli into changes in gene expression during heart failure. In this study our goals were (i) to develop a sound statistical method to establish a comprehensive cutoff point for identification of differentially expressed genes, (ii) to identify a gene expression fingerprint for heart failure, (iii) to attempt to distinguish different etiologies of heart failure by their gene expression fingerprint, and (iv) to identify gene clusters that show coordinated up- or down-regulation in human heart failure. We used oligonucleotide micro-arrays to profile seven non-failing (NF) and eight failing (F) human hearts with a diagnosis of end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy. Biological and experimental variability of the hybridization data were analyzed, and then a statistical analysis procedure was developed, including Student's t test after log-transformation and Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test. A comprehensive cutoff point composed of fold change, average difference, and absolute call was then established and validated by TaqMan PCR. Of 6,606 genes on the GeneChip, 103 genes in 10 functional groups were differentially expressed between F and NF hearts. A dendrogram identified a gene expression fingerprint of F and NF hearts and also distinguished two F hearts with distinct etiologies (familial and alcoholic cardiomyopathy, respectively) with different expression patterns. K means clustering also revealed two potentially novel pathways associated with up-regulation of atrial natriuretic factor and brain natriuretic peptide and with increased expression of extracellular matrix proteins. Gene expression fingerprints may be useful indicators of heart failure etiologies.},

Single-cell genomics can characterize cell identity and function, but limitations of ease and scale have prevented its broad application. Here we describe Drop-seq, a strategy for quickly profiling thousands of individual cells by separating them into nanoliter-sized aqueous droplets, associating a different barcode with each cell's RNAs, and sequencing them all together. Drop-seq analyzes mRNA transcripts from thousands of individual cells simultaneously while remembering transcripts' cell of origin. We analyzed transcriptomes from 44,808 mouse retinal cells and identified 39 transcriptionally distinct cell populations, creating a molecular atlas of gene expression for known retinal cell classes and novel candidate cell subtypes. Drop-seq will accelerate biological discovery by enabling routine transcriptional profiling at single-cell resolution. Video Abstract},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB), caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Efforts to control it are hampered by difficulties with diagnosis, prevention and treatment. Most people infected with M. tuberculosis remain asymptomatic, termed latent TB, with a 10{\%} lifetime risk of developing active TB disease. Current tests, however, cannot identify which individuals will develop disease. The immune response to M. tuberculosis is complex and incompletely characterized, hindering development of new diagnostics, therapies and vaccines. Here we identify a whole-blood 393 transcript signature for active TB in intermediate and high-burden settings, correlating with radiological extent of disease and reverting to that of healthy controls after treatment. A subset of patients with latent TB had signatures similar to those in patients with active TB. We also identify a specific 86-transcript signature that discriminates active TB from other inflammatory and infectious diseases. Modular and pathway analysis revealed that the TB signature was dominated by a neutrophil-driven interferon (IFN)-inducible gene profile, consisting of both IFN-gamma and type I IFN-alphabeta signalling. Comparison with transcriptional signatures in purified cells and flow cytometric analysis suggest that this TB signature reflects changes in cellular composition and altered gene expression. Although an IFN-inducible signature was also observed in whole blood of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), their complete modular signature differed from TB, with increased abundance of plasma cell transcripts. Our studies demonstrate a hitherto underappreciated role of type I IFN-alphabeta signalling in the pathogenesis of TB, which has implications for vaccine and therapeutic development. Our study also provides a broad range of transcriptional biomarkers with potential as diagnostic and prognostic tools to combat the TB epidemic.},

abstract = {Single-cell transcriptomics yields ever growing data sets containing RNA expression levels for thousands of genes from up to millions of cells. Common data analysis pipelines include a dimensionality reduction step for visualising the data in two dimensions, most frequently performed using t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE). It excels at revealing local structure in high-dimensional data, but naive applications often suffer from severe shortcomings, e.g. the global structure of the data is not represented accurately. Here we describe how to circumvent such pitfalls, and develop a protocol for creating more faithful t-SNE visualisations. It includes PCA initialisation, a high learning rate, and multi-scale similarity kernels; for very large data sets, we additionally use exaggeration and downsampling-based initialisation. We use published single-cell RNA-seq data sets to demonstrate that this protocol yields superior results compared to the naive application of t-SNE.},

abstract = {Single-cell genomics and single-cell transcriptomics have emerged as powerful tools to study the biology of single cells at a genome-wide scale. However, a major challenge is to sequence both genomic DNA and mRNA from the same cell, which would allow direct comparison of genomic variation and transcriptome heterogeneity. We describe a quasilinear amplification strategy to quantify genomic DNA and mRNA from the same cell without physically separating the nucleic acids before amplification. We show that the efficiency of our integrated approach is similar to existing methods for single-cell sequencing of either genomic DNA or mRNA. Further, we find that genes with high cell-to-cell variability in transcript numbers generally have lower genomic copy numbers, and vice versa, suggesting that copy number variations may drive variability in gene expression among individual cells. Applications of our integrated sequencing approach could range from gaining insights into cancer evolution and heterogeneity to understanding the transcriptional consequences of copy number variations in healthy and diseased tissues.},

abstract = {Genome-wide ‘omics'-assays provide a comprehensive view on the molecular landscapes of healthy and diseased cells. Bioinformatics traditionally pursues a ‘gene-centered' view by extracting lists of genes differentially expressed or methylated between healthy and diseased states. Biological knowledge mining is then performed by applying gene set techniques using libraries of functional gene sets obtained from independent studies. This analysis strategy neglects two facts: (i) that different disease states can be characterized by a series of functional modules of co-regulated genes and (ii) that the topology of the underlying regulatory networks can induce complex expression patterns that require analysis methods beyond traditional genes set techniques. The authors here provide a knowledge discovery method that overcomes these shortcomings. It combines machine learning using self-organizing maps with pathway flow analysis. It extracts and visualizes regulatory modes from molecular omics data, maps them onto selected pathways and estimates the impact of pathway-activity changes. The authors illustrate the performance of the gene set and pathway signal flow methods using expression data of oncogenic pathway activation experiments and of patient data on glioma, B-cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer.},

abstract = {Background: Whole‐genome studies of vine cultivars have brought novel knowledge about the diversity, geographical relatedness, historical origin and dissemination, phenotype associations and genetic markers. Method: We applied SOM (self‐organizing maps) portrayal, a neural network‐based machine learning method, to re‐analyze the genome‐wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data of nearly eight hundred grapevine cultivars. The method generates genome‐specific data landscapes. Their topology reflects the geographical distribution of cultivars, indicates paths of cultivar dissemination in history and genome‐phenotype associations about grape utilization. Results: The landscape of vine genomes resembles the geographic map of the Mediterranean world, reflecting two major dissemination paths from South Caucasus along a northern route via Balkan towards Western Europe and along a southern route via Palestine and Maghreb towards Iberian Peninsula. The Mediterranean and Black Sea, as well as the Pyrenees, constitute barriers for genetic exchange. On the coarsest level of stratification, cultivars divide into three major groups: Western Europe and Italian grapes, Iberian grapes and vine cultivars from Near East and Maghreb regions. Genetic landmarks were associated with agronomic traits, referring to their utilization as table and wine grapes. Pseudotime analysis describes the dissemination of grapevines in an East to West direction in different waves of cultivation. Conclusion: In analogy to the tasks of the wine waiter in gastronomy, the sommelier, our ‘SOMmelier'‐approach supports understanding the diversity of grapevine genomes in the context of their geographic and historical background, using SOM portrayal. It offers an option to supplement vine cultivar passports by genome fingerprint portraits.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Patients who have unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation have prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival when receiving treatment with BRAF inhibitors plus MEK inhibitors. However, long-term clinical outcomes in these patients remain undefined. To determine 5-year survival rates and clinical characteristics of the patients with durable benefit, we sought to review long-term data from randomized trials of combination therapy with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. METHODS We analyzed pooled extended-survival data from two trials involving previously untreated patients who had received BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (at a dose of 150 mg twice daily) plus MEK inhibitor trametinib (2 mg once daily) in the COMBI-d and COMBI-v trials. The median duration of follow-up was 22 months (range, 0 to 76). The primary end points in the COMBI-d and COMBI-v trials were progression-free survival and overall survival, respectively. RESULTS A total of 563 patients were randomly assigned to receive dabrafenib plus trametinib (211 in the COMBI-d trial and 352 in the COMBI-v trial). The progressionfree survival rates were 21{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 17 to 24) at 4 years and 19{\%} (95{\%} CI, 15 to 22) at 5 years. The overall survival rates were 37{\%} (95{\%} CI, 33 to 42) at 4 years and 34{\%} (95{\%} CI, 30 to 38) at 5 years. In multivariate analysis, several baseline factors (e.g., performance status, age, sex, number of organ sites with metastasis, and lactate dehydrogenase level) were significantly associated with both progression-free survival and overall survival. A complete response occurred in 109 patients (19{\%}) and was associated with an improved long-term outcome, with an overall survival rate of 71{\%} (95{\%} CI, 62 to 79) at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS First-line treatment with dabrafenib plus trametinib led to long-term benefit in approximately one third of the patients who had unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation.},

Peripheral blood is a complex mixture of cell types and some differences in peripheral blood gene expression may reflect the timing of sample collection rather than an underlying disease process. For this reason, it is important to assess study design factors that may cause variability in gene expression not related to what is being analyzed. Variation in the gene expression of circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from three healthy volunteers sampled three times one day each week for one month was examined for 1,176 genes printed on filter arrays. Less than 1{\%} of the genes showed any variation in expression that was related to the time of collection, and none of the changes were noted in more than one individual. These results suggest that observed variation was due to experimental variability.},

abstract = {Wound-induced hair follicle neogenesis (WIHN) has been an important model to study hair follicle regeneration during wound repair. However, the cellular and molecular components of the dermis that make large wounds more regenerative are not fully understood. Here, we compare and contrast recently published scRNA-seq data of small scarring wounds to wounds that regenerate in hope to elucidate the role of fibroblasts lineages in WIHN. Our analysis revealed an over-representation of the newly identified upper wound fibroblasts in regenerative wound conditions, which express the retinoic acid binding protein Crabp1. This regenerative cell type shares a similar gene signature to the murine papillary fibroblast lineage, which are necessary to support hair follicle morphogenesis and homeostasis. RNA velocity analysis comparing scarring and regenerating wounds revealed the divergent trajectories towards upper and lower wound fibroblasts and that the upper populations were closely associated with the specialized dermal papilla. We also provide analyses and explanation reconciling the inconsistency between the histological lineage tracing and the scRNA-seq data from recent reports investigating large wounds. Finally, we performed a computational test to map the spatial location of upper wound fibroblasts in large wounds which revealed that upper peripheral fibroblasts might harbour equivalent regenerative competence as those in the centre. Overall, our scRNA-seq reanalysis combining multiple samples suggests that upper wound fibroblasts are required for hair follicle regeneration and that papillary fibroblasts may migrate from the wound periphery to the centre during wound re-epithelialization. Moreover, data from this publication are made available on our searchable web resource: https://skinregeneration.org/.},

Additionally, blood-based diagnostics can classify tumors into distinct molecular subtypes and monitor disease relapse and response to treatment. Increasingly, biomarker strategies are becoming critical to identify a specific patient subpopulation that is likely to respond to a new therapeutic agent. The improved understanding of the underlying molecular features of common cancers and the availability of a multitude of recently developed technologies to interrogate the genome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of tumors and biological fluids have made it possible to develop clinically applicable and cost-effective tests for many common cancers. Overall, the paradigm shift towards personalized and individualized medicine relies heavily on the increased use of diagnostic biomarkers and classifiers to improve diagnosis, management and treatment. International collaborations, involving both the private and public sector will be required to facilitate the development of clinical applications of biomarkers, using rigorous standardized assays.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Application of transcriptomics technology in human nutrition intervention studies would allow for genome-wide screening of the effects of specific diets or nutrients and result in biomarker profiles. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the potential of gene expression profiling in blood cells collected in a human intervention study that investigated the effect of a high-carbohydrate (HC) or a high-protein (HP) breakfast on satiety. DESIGN: Blood samples were taken from 8 healthy men before and 2 h after consumption of an HP or an HC breakfast. Both breakfasts contained acetaminophen for measuring the gastric emptying rate. Analysis of the transcriptome data focused on the effects of the HP or HC breakfast and of acetaminophen on blood leukocyte gene expression profiles. RESULTS: Breakfast consumption resulted in differentially expressed genes, 317 for the HC breakfast and 919 for the HP breakfast. Immune response and signal transduction, specifically T cell receptor signaling and nuclear transcription factor kappaB signaling, were the overrepresented functional groups in the set of 141 genes that were differentially expressed in response to both breakfasts. Consumption of the HC breakfast resulted in differential expression of glycogen metabolism genes, and consumption of the HP breakfast resulted in differential expression of genes involved in protein biosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression changes in blood leukocytes corresponded with and may be related to the difference in macronutrient content of the breakfast, meal consumption as such, and acetaminophen exposure. This study illustrates the potential of gene expression profiling in blood to study the effects of dietary exposure in human intervention studies.},

We aimed to estimate the mortality rate of COVID-19 vaccination and presented characteristics of deaths following COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: Data on deaths following COVID-19 vaccination were obtained from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) from December 11, 2020 through January 8, 2021. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID Data Tracker was used to identify the total number of people receiving COVID-19 vaccines during the same period to estimate the mortality rate. Stratified analysis was conducted by the location of vaccination. Results: As of January 8, 2021, 55 deaths were reported, and the mortality rate of COVID-19 vaccination was 8.2 per million population. A total of 37 deaths were reported among long-term care facility residents, and the mortality rate was 53.4 per million population. Top reported comorbidities associated with deaths included hypertension, dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, and heart failure. In addition, dementia was more likely to be associated with deaths vaccinated at long-term care facilities than at other locations. Conclusion: The benefits of COVID-19 vaccines outweigh the potential risks in older frail populations, and our findings do not support actions to exclude older adults from being vaccinated. However, continued monitoring of COVID-19 vaccination is still warranted.},

abstract = {Background: Single-cell RNA-seq is a powerful tool for measuring gene expression at the resolution of individual cells. A challenge in the analysis of this data is the large amount of zero values, representing either missing data or no expression. Several imputation approaches have been proposed to address this issue, but they generally rely on structure inherent to the dataset under consideration they may not provide any additional information, hence, are limited by the information contained therein and the validity of their assumptions. Methods: We evaluated the risk of generating false positive or irreproducible differential expression when imputing data with six different methods. We applied each method to a variety of simulated datasets as well as to permuted real single-cell RNA-seq datasets and consider the number of false positive gene-gene correlations and differentially expressed genes. Using matched 10X and Smart-seq2 data we examined whether cell-type specific markers were reproducible across datasets derived from the same tissue before and after imputation. Results: The extent of false-positives introduced by imputation varied considerably by method. Data smoothing based methods, MAGIC, knn-smooth and dca, generated many false-positives in both real and simulated data. Model-based imputation methods typically generated fewer false-positives but this varied greatly depending on the diversity of cell-types in the sample. All imputation methods decreased the reproducibility of cell-type specific markers, although this could be mitigated by selecting markers with large effect size and significance. Conclusions: Imputation of single-cell RNA-seq data introduces circularity that can generate false-positive results. Thus, statistical tests applied to imputed data should be treated with care. Additional filtering by effect size can reduce but not fully eliminate these effects. Of the methods we considered, SAVER was the least likely to generate false or irreproducible results, thus should be favoured over alternatives if imputation is necessary.},

abstract = {Background: Activation of telomere maintenance mechanisms (TMMs) is a hallmark of most cancers, and is required to prevent genome instability and to establish cellular immortality through reconstitution of capping of chromosome ends. TMM depends on the cancer type. Comparative studies linking tumor biology and TMM have potential impact for evaluating cancer onset and development. Methods: We have studied alterations of telomere length, their sequence composition and transcriptional regulation in mismatch repair deficient colorectal cancers arising in Lynch syndrome (LS-CRC) and microsatellite instable (MSI) sporadic CRC (MSI s-CRC), and for comparison, in microsatellite stable (MSS) s-CRC and in benign colon mucosa. Our study applied bioinformatics analysis of whole genome DNA and RNA sequencing data and a pathway model to study telomere length alterations and the potential effect of the “classical” telomerase (TEL-) and alternative (ALT-) TMM using transcriptomic signatures. Results: We have found progressive decrease of mean telomere length in all cancer subtypes compared with reference systems. Our results support the view that telomere attrition is an early event in tumorigenesis. TMM gets activated in all tumors studied due to concerted overexpression of a large fraction of genes with direct relation to telomere function, where only a very small fraction of them showed recurrent mutations. TEL-related transcriptional state was dominating in all CRC subtypes, showing, however, subtype-specific activation patterns; while contribution of the ALT-TMM was slightly more prominent in the hypermutated MSI s-CRC and LS-CRC. TEL-TMM is mainly activated by over-expression of DKC1 and/or TERT genes and their interaction partners, where DKC1 is more prominent in MSS than in MSI s-CRC and can serve as a transcriptomic marker of TMM activity. Conclusions: Our results suggest that transcriptional patterns are indicative for TMM pathway activation with subtle differences between TEL and ALT mechanisms in a CRC subtype-specific fashion. Sequencing data potentially provide a suited measure to study alterations of telomere length and of underlying transcriptional regulation. Further studies are needed to improve this method.},

abstract = {Mutually linked expression and methylation dynamics in the brain govern genome regulation over the whole lifetime with an impact on cognition, psychological disorders, and cancer. We performed a joint study of gene expression and DNA methylation of brain tissue originating from the human prefrontal cortex of individuals across the lifespan to describe changes in cellular programs and their regulation by epigenetic mechanisms. The analysis considers previous knowledge in terms of functional gene signatures and chromatin states derived from independent studies, aging profiles of a battery of chromatin modifying enzymes, and data of gliomas and neuropsychological disorders for a holistic view on the development and aging of the brain. Expression and methylation changes from babies to elderly adults decompose into different modes associated with the serial activation of (brain) developmental, learning, metabolic and inflammatory functions, where methylation in gene promoters mostly represses transcription. Expression of genes encoding methylome modifying enzymes is very diverse reflecting complex regulations during lifetime which also associates with the marked remodeling of chromatin between permissive and restrictive states. Data of brain cancer and psychotic disorders reveal footprints of pathophysiologies related to brain development and aging. Comparison of aging brains with gliomas supports the view that glioblastoma-like and astrocytoma-like tumors exhibit higher cellular plasticity activated in the developing healthy brain while oligodendrogliomas have a more stable differentiation hierarchy more resembling the aged brain. The balance and specific shifts between volatile and stable and between more irreversible and more plastic epigenomic networks govern the development and aging of healthy and diseased brain.},

Methods: Here, we analyzed a BRAFV600E-mutant melanoma cell line by single-cell RNA-seq under various conditions: cells sensitiveto BRAF inhibition with BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and cells resistant to BRAF inhibition with vemurafenib alone or vemurafenibin combination with the MEK1/2 inhibitors cobimetinib or trametinib. Dimensionality reduction by t-distributed stochasticneighbor embedding and self-organizing maps identified distinct trajectories of resistance development clearly separating the 4treatment conditions in cell and gene state space. Results: Trajectories associated with resistance to single-agent treatment involved cell cycle, extracellular matrix, and de-differentiationprograms. In contrast, shifts detected in double-resistant cells primarily affected translation and mitogen-activated protein kinasepathway reactivation, with a small subpopulation showing markers of pluripotency. These findings were validated in pseudotimeanalyses and RNA velocity measurements. Conclusions: The single-cell transcriptomic analyses reported here employed a spectrum of bioinformatics methods to identifymechanisms of melanoma resistance to single- and double-agent treatments.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The increasing burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in the ageing population of industrialized nations requires an intensive search for means of reducing this epidemic. In order to improve prevention, detection, therapy and prognosis of cardiovascular diseases on the population level in Eastern Germany, it is necessary to examine reasons for the East-West gradient of CVD morbidity and mortality, potential causal mechanisms and prognostic factors in the elderly. Psychosocial and nutritional factors have previously been discussed as possible causes for the unexplained part of the East-West gradient. A reduced heart rate variability appears to be associated with cardiovascular disease as well as with psychosocial and other cardiovascular risk factors and decreases with age. Nevertheless, there is a lack of population-based data to examine the role of heart rate variability and its interaction with psychosocial and nutritional factors regarding the effect on cardiovascular disease in the ageing population. There also is a paucity of epidemiological data describing the health situation in Eastern Germany. Therefore, we conduct a population-based study to examine the distribution of CVD, heart rate variability and CVD risk factors and their associations in an elderly East German population. This paper describes the design and objectives of the CARLA Study. METHODS/DESIGN: For this study, a random sample of 45-80 year-old inhabitants of the city of Halle (Saale) in Eastern Germany was drawn from the population registry. By the end of the baseline examination (2002-2005), 1750 study participants will have been examined. A multi-step recruitment strategy aims at achieving a 70{\%} response rate. Detailed information is collected on own and family medical history, socioeconomic, psychosocial, behavioural and biomedical factors. Medical examinations include anthropometric measures, blood pressure of arm and ankle, a 10-second and a 20-minute electrocardiogram, a general physical examination, an echocardiogram, and laboratory analyses of venous blood samples. On 200 participants, a 24-hour electrocardiogram is recorded. A detailed system of quality control ensures high data quality. A follow-up examination is planned. DISCUSSION: This study will help to elucidate pathways to CVD involving autonomic dysfunction and lifestyle factors which might be responsible for the CVD epidemic in some populations.},

abstract = {Polycomb group proteins (PCGs) are involved in repression of genes that are required for stem cell differentiation. Recently, it was shown that promoters of PCG target genes (PCGTs) are 12-fold more likely to be methylated in cancer than non-PCGTs. Age is the most important demographic risk factor for cancer, and we hypothesized that its carcinogenic potential may be referred by irreversibly stabilizing stem cell features. To test this, we analyzed the methylation status of over 27,000 CpGs mapping to promoters of ∼14,000 genes in whole blood samples from 261 postmenopausal women. We demonstrate that stem cell PCGTs are far more likely to become methylated with age than non-targets (odds ratio = 5.3 [3.8-7.4], P {\textless} 10-10), independently of sex, tissue type, disease state, and methylation platform. We identified a specific subset of 69 PCGT CpGs that undergo hypermethylation with age and validated this methylation signature in seven independent data sets encompassing over 900 samples, including normal and cancer solid tissues and a population of bone marrow mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (P {\textless} 10-5). We find that the age-PCGT methylation signature is present in preneoplastic conditions and may drive gene expression changes associated with carcinogenesis. These findings shed substantial novel insights into the epigenetic effects of aging and support the view that age may predispose to malignant transformation by irreversibly stabilizing stem cell features. {\textcopyright} 2010 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

Planarians are flatworms and regenerate from tiny body fragments, a process requiring a population of proliferating cells (neoblasts). Whether regeneration is accomplished by pluripotent cells or by the collective activity of multiple lineage-restricted cell types is unknown. We used ionizing radiation and single-cell transplantation to identify neoblasts that can form large descendant-cell colonies in vivo. These clonogenic neoblasts (cNeoblasts) produce cells that differentiate into neuronal, intestinal, and other known postmitotic cell types and are distributed throughout the body. Single transplanted cNeoblasts restored regeneration in lethally irradiated hosts. We conclude that broadly distributed, adult pluripotent stem cells underlie the remarkable regenerative abilities of planarians.},

In the study described here, microarrays were employed to analyze gene transcription in peripheral blood mononuclear cells prepared from serial blood samples that had been obtained, at weekly intervals, from apparently healthy human volunteers. Transcript levels for the majority of genes examined were found to be remarkably consistent within samples from a single donor. Conversely, marked differences were observed in samples obtained from different donors. Genes that exhibited differential expression dependent on sex, age, body mass index, and the presence of varying proportions of different leukocyte subsets were identified. These results emphasize the important contributions of genetic and environmental factors, as well as varying representation of different cell types, in determining the overall gene transcriptional profiles of human tissues. However, the study also provides evidence that, within an individual, the gene transcription profiles of sampled tissues can be comparatively stable over time.},

abstract = {Background: Short telomeres in peripheral blood leukocytes are associated with older age and age-related diseases. We tested the hypotheses that short telomeres are associated with both increased cancer mortality and all-cause mortality. Methods: Individuals (n = 64637) were recruited from 1991 onwards from two Danish prospective cohort studies: the Copenhagen City Heart Study and the Copenhagen General Population Study. All had telomere length measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the genotypes rs1317082 (TERC), rs7726159 (TERT), and rs2487999 (OBFC1) determined. The sum of telomere-shortening alleles from these three genotypes was calculated. We conducted Cox regression analyses and instrumental variable analyses using the allele sum as an instrument. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Among 7607 individuals who died during follow-up (0-22 years, median = 7 years), 2420 had cancer and 2633 had cardiovascular disease as causes of death. Decreasing telomere length deciles were associated with increasing all-cause mortality (P trend = 2∗10-15). The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio of all-cause mortality was 1.40 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.25 to 1.57) for individuals in the shortest vs the longest decile. Results were similar for cancer mortality and cardiovascular mortality. Telomere length decreased 69 base pairs (95{\%} CI = 61 to 76) per allele for the allele sum, and the per-allele hazard ratio for cancer mortality was 0.95 (95{\%} CI = 0.91 to 0.99). Allele sum was not associated with cardiovascular, other, or all-cause mortality. Conclusion: Short telomeres in peripheral blood leukocytes were associated with high mortality in association analyses. In contrast, genetically determined short telomeres were associated with low cancer mortality but not with all-cause mortality.},

We analyzed 3D whole body scanning data of nearly 10,000 participants of a cohort collected from the adult population of Leipzig, one of the largest cities in Eastern Germany. We present a novel approach for the systematic analysis of this data which aims at identifying distinguishable clusters of body shapes called body types. In the first step, our method aggregates body measures provided by the scanner into meta-measures, each representing one relevant dimension of the body shape. In a next step, we stratified the cohort into body types and assessed their stability and dependence on the size of the underlying cohort. Using self-organizing maps (SOM) we identified thirteen robust meta-measures and fifteen body types comprising between 1 and 18 percent of the total cohort size. Thirteen of them are virtually gender specific (six for women and seven for men) and thus reflect most abundant body shapes of women and men. Two body types include both women and men, and describe androgynous body shapes that lack typical gender specific features. The body types disentangle a large variability of body shapes enabling distinctions which go beyond the traditional indices such as body mass index, the waist-to-height ratio, the waist-to-hip ratio and the mortality-hazard ABSI-index. In a next step, we will link the identified body types with disease predispositions to study how size and shape of the human body impact health and disease.},

Because of its relationship to aging, telomere length measurement was considered an important biomarker to develop on these subjects. To assay relative telomere length (TL) on this large cohort over a short time period, we created a novel high throughput robotic system for TL analysis and informatics. Samples were run in triplicate, along with control samples, in a randomized design. As part of quality control, we determined the within-sample variability and employed thresholds for the elimination of outlying measurements. Of 106,902 samples assayed, 105,539 (98.7{\%}) passed all quality control (QC) measures. As expected, TL in general showed a decline with age and a sex difference. While telomeres showed a negative correlation with age up to 75 years, in those older than 75 years, age positively correlated with longer telomeres, indicative of an association of longer telomeres with more years of survival in those older than 75. Furthermore, while females in general had longer telomeres than males, this difference was significant only for those older than age 50. An additional novel finding was that the variance of TL between individuals increased with age. This study establishes reliable assay and analysis methodologies for measurement of TL in large, population-based human studies. The GERA cohort represents the largest currently available such resource, linked to comprehensive electronic health and genotype data for analysis.},

abstract = {Recent studies revealed trajectories of mutational events in early melanomagenesis, but the accompanying changes in gene expression are far less understood. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive RNA-seq analysis of laser-microdissected melanocytic nevi (n = 23) and primary melanoma samples (n = 57) and characterized the molecular mechanisms of early melanoma development. Using self-organizing maps, unsupervised clustering, and analysis of pseudotime (PT) dynamics to identify evolutionary trajectories, we describe here two transcriptomic types of melanocytic nevi (N1 and N2) and primary melanomas (M1 and M2). N1/M1 lesions are characterized by pigmentation-type and MITF gene signatures, and a high prevalence of NRAS mutations in M1 melanomas. N2/M2 lesions are characterized by inflammatory-type and AXL gene signatures with an equal distribution of wild-type and mutated BRAF and low prevalence of NRAS mutations in M2 melanomas. Interestingly, N1 nevi and M1 melanomas and N2 nevi and M2 melanomas, respectively, cluster together, but there is no clustering in a stage-dependent manner. Transcriptional signatures of M1 melanomas harbor signatures of BRAF/MEK inhibitor resistance and M2 melanomas harbor signatures of anti-PD-1 antibody treatment resistance. Pseudotime dynamics of nevus and melanoma samples are suggestive for a switch-like immune-escape mechanism in melanoma development with downregulation of immune genes paralleled by an increasing expression of a cell cycle signature in late-stage melanomas. Taken together, the transcriptome analysis identifies gene signatures and mechanisms underlying development of melanoma in early and late stages with relevance for diagnostics and therapy.},

abstract = {We evaluated gene expression in the peripheral blood of Mayak workers in relationship to occupational chronic exposure to identify permanent post-exposure signatures. The Mayak workers had experienced either a combined exposure to incorporated (239)Pu and external gamma rays (n = 82) or exposure to external gamma rays (n = 18). Fifty unexposed individuals served as controls. Peripheral blood was collected and then the RNA was isolated, converting it into cDNA and stored at -20 degrees C. In a previous study at stage I, we screened the mRNA and microRNA transcriptome using 40 of the 150 samples and identified 95 mRNAs and 45 microRNAs. In stage II of this study, we now validated our 140 candidate genes using the qRT-PCR technique for the remaining 92 blood samples (18 samples were lost due to methodological reasons). We analyzed associations of normalized gene expression values in linear models separately for both exposure types (continuous and categorical scales) and adjusted for exposure age as well as stratified by gender. After further adjustment for confounders such as chronic non-cancer diseases or age at biosampling, mostly binary (on/off) dose-to-gene relationships were found for 15 mRNAs and 15 microRNAs, of which 8 mRNAs and 6 microRNAs remained significant after Bonferroni correction. Almost all of them were associated with plutonium incorporation and gender. Our study provides mRNA and microRNA gene expression changes dependent on the exposure type and gender, which occur and seem to persist after chronic radiation exposures supporting the concept of permanent post-exposure signatures.},

However, an elaborate and comprehensive transcriptome reference of the whole blood system is lacking. Here, we profiled the transcriptomes of 7551 human blood cells representing 32 immunophenotypic cell types, including hematopoietic stem cells, progenitors and mature blood cells derived from 21 healthy donors. With high sequencing depth and coverage, we constructed a single-cell transcriptional atlas of blood cells (ABC) on the basis of both protein-coding genes and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and showed a high consistence between them. Notably, putative lncRNAs and transcription factors regulating hematopoietic cell differentiation were identified. While common transcription factor regulatory networks were activated in neutrophils and monocytes, lymphoid cells dramatically changed their regulatory networks during differentiation. Furthermore, we showed a subset of nucleated erythrocytes actively expressing immune signals, suggesting the existence of erythroid precursors with immune functions. Finally, a web portal offering transcriptome browsing and blood cell type prediction has been established. Thus, our work provides a transcriptional map of human blood cells at single-cell resolution, thereby offering a comprehensive reference for the exploration of physiological and pathological hematopoiesis.},

Obesity has a more pronounced impact on morbidity than on mortality. Disability due to obesity-related cardiovascular diseases will increase particularly in industrialized countries, as patients survive cardiovascular diseases in these countries more often than in nonindustrialized countries. Disability due to obesity-related type 2 diabetes will increase particularly in industrializing countries, as insulin supply is usually insufficient in these countries. As a result, in these countries, an increase in disabling nephropathy, arteriosclerosis, neuropathy, and retinopathy is expected. Increases in the prevalence of obesity will potentially lead to an increase in the number of years that subjects suffer from obesity-related morbidity and disability. A 1{\%} increase in the prevalence of obesity in such countries as India and China leads to 20 million additional cases of obesity. Prevention programs will stem the obesity epidemic more efficiently than weight-loss programs. However, only a few prevention programs have been developed or implemented, and the success rates reported to date have been low. Obesity prevention programs should be high on the scientific and political agenda in both industrialized and industrializing countries.},

abstract = {Background: Sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated systemic immune response to infection, associates with reduced responsiveness to subsequent infections. How such tolerance is acquired is not well understood but is known to involve epigenetic and transcriptional dysregulation. Methods: Bead arrays were used to compare global DNA methylation changes in patients with sepsis, non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and healthy controls. Bioinformatic analyses were performed to dissect functional reprogramming and signaling pathways related to the acquisition of these specific DNA methylation alterations. Finally, in vitro experiments using human monocytes were performed to test the induction of similar DNA methylation reprogramming. Results: Here, we focused on DNA methylation changes associated with sepsis, given their potential role in stabilizing altered phenotypes. Tolerized monocytes from patients with sepsis display changes in their DNA methylomes with respect to those from healthy controls, affecting critical monocyte-related genes. DNA methylation profiles correlate with IL-10 and IL-6 levels, significantly increased in monocytes in sepsis, as well as with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score; the observed changes associate with TFs and pathways downstream to toll-like receptors and inflammatory cytokines. In fact, in vitro stimulation of toll-like receptors in monocytes results in similar gains and losses of methylation together with the acquisition of tolerance. Conclusion: We have identified a DNA methylation signature associated with sepsis that is downstream to the response of monocytes to inflammatory signals associated with the acquisition of a tolerized phenotype and organic dysfunction.},

abstract = {Melanoma, a cancer of the skin, arises from transformed melanocytes. Melanoma has the highest mutational burden of any cancer partially attributed to UV induced DNA damage. Localized melanoma is “curable” by surgical resection and is followed by radiation therapy to eliminate any remaining cancer cells. Targeted therapies against components of the MAPK signaling cascade and immunotherapies which block immune checkpoints have shown remarkable clinical responses, however with the onset of resistance in most patients, and, disease relapse, these patients eventually become refractory to treatments. Although great advances have been made in our understanding of the metastatic process in cancers including melanoma, therapy failure suggests that much remains to be learned and understood about the multi-step process of tumor metastasis. In this review we provide an overview of melanocytic transformation into malignant melanoma and key molecular events that occur during this evolution. A better understanding of the complex processes entailing cancer cell dissemination will improve the mechanistic driven design of therapies that target specific steps involved in cancer metastasis to improve clinical response rates and overall survival in all cancer patients.},

abstract = {Motivation: Repeated cross-sectional time series single cell data confound several sources of variation, with contributions from measurement noise, stochastic cell-to-cell variation and cell progression at different rates. Time series from single cell assays are particularly susceptible to confounding as the measurements are not averaged over populations of cells. When several genes are assayed in parallel these effects can be estimated and corrected for under certain smoothness assumptions on cell progression. Results: We present a principled probabilistic model with a Bayesian inference scheme to analyse such data. We demonstrate our method's utility on public microarray, nCounter and RNA-seq datasets from three organisms. Our method almost perfectly recovers withheld capture times in an Arabidopsis dataset, it accurately estimates cell cycle peak times in a human prostate cancer cell line and it correctly identifies two precocious cells in a study of paracrine signalling in mouse dendritic cells. Furthermore, our method compares favourably with Monocle, a state-of-the-art technique. We also show using held-out data that uncertainty in the temporal dimension is a common confounder and should be accounted for in analyses of repeated cross-sectional time series.

Treatment with various drugs, including cisplatin and vemurafenib, uniformly leads to enrichment of slow-cycling, long-term tumor-maintaining melanoma cells expressing the H3K4-demethylase JARID1B/KDM5B/PLU-1. Proteome-profiling revealed an upregulation in enzymes of mitochondrial oxidative-ATP-synthesis (oxidative phosphorylation) in this subpopulation. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration blocked the emergence of the JARID1Bhigh subpopulation and sensitized melanoma cells to therapy, independent of their genotype. Our findings support a two-tiered approach combining anticancer agents that eliminate rapidly proliferating melanoma cells with inhibitors of the drug-resistant slow-cycling subpopulation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {There is growing evidence that gene expression profiling of peripheral blood cells is a valuable tool for assessing gene signatures related to exposure, drug-response, or disease. However, the true promise of this approach can not be estimated until the scientific community has robust baseline data describing variation in gene expression patterns in normal individuals. Using a large representative sample set of postmenopausal women (N = 286) in the Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) postgenome study, we investigated variability of whole blood gene expression in the general population. In particular, we examined changes in blood gene expression caused by technical variability, normal inter-individual differences, and exposure variables at proportions and levels relevant to real-life situations. We observe that the overall changes in gene expression are subtle, implying the need for careful analytic approaches of the data. In particular, technical variability may not be ignored and subsequent adjustments must be considered in any analysis. Many new candidate genes were identified that are differentially expressed according to inter-individual (i.e. fasting, BMI) and exposure (i.e. smoking) factors, thus establishing that these effects are mirrored in blood. By focusing on the biological implications instead of directly comparing gene lists from several related studies in the literature, our analytic approach was able to identify significant similarities and effects consistent across these reports. This establishes the feasibility of blood gene expression profiling, if they are predicated upon careful experimental design and analysis in order to minimize confounding signals, artifacts of sample preparation and processing, and inter-individual differences. {\textcopyright} 2010 Dumeaux et al.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyse changes in body weight and height, and the changes in the prevalence of overweight and obesity. DESIGN: Prospective population based study with 11-year follow-up. SUBJECTS: Norwegian men (n=21565) and women (n=24337) aged 20 years or more who participated in two health surveys, the first in 1984-1986 and the other in 1995-1997. MEASUREMENTS: Height and weight were measured by using standardised procedures at both surveys, and we computed body mass index (BMI) as weight in kilo divided by the squared value of height in meters. RESULTS: Participants who were younger than 50 years at the first survey showed a large increase in body weight, and men and women aged 20-29 years increased their weight with an average of 7.9 kg and 7.3 kg, respectively. Contradictory, participants who were 70 years or older had on average a weight loss. The prevalence of overweight (BMI=25.0-29.9 kg/m(2)) and obesity (BMI{\textgreater}/=30 kg/m(2)) increased between the surveys, especially in the youngest age groups. Overall, the proportion classified as obese increased from 6.7 to 15.5{\%} among men and from 11.0 to 21.0{\%} among women. Some of this increase was due to a reduction in height, which was most pronounced in the oldest age groups. CONCLUSION: During approximately 10 years, body weight increased in all age groups below 70 years, and the prevalence of overweight and obese persons was approximately 20{\%} higher at the second survey compared with the first survey},

abstract = {The spread of SARS-CoV-2 created a pandemic crisis with {\textgreater} 150,000 cumulative cases in {\textgreater} 65 countries within a few months. The reproductive number (R) is a metric to estimate the transmission of a pathogen during an outbreak. Preliminary published estimates were based on the initial outbreak in China. Whole genome sequences (WGS) analysis found mutational variations in the viral genome; however, previous comparisons failed to show a direct relationship between viral genome diversity, transmission, and the epidemic severity. COVID-19 incidences from different countries were modeled over the epidemic curve. Estimates of the instantaneous R (Wallinga and Teunis method) with a short and standard serial interval were done. WGS were used to determine the populations genomic variation and that underpinned creation of the pathogen genome identity (GENI) score, which was merged with the outbreak curve in four distinct phases. Inference of transmission time was based on a mutation rate of 2 mutations/month. R estimates revealed differences in the transmission and variable infection dynamics between and within outbreak progression for each country examined. Outside China, our R estimates observed propagating dynamics indicating that other countries were poised to move to the takeoff and exponential stages. Population density and local temperatures had no clear relationship to the outbreak progression. Integration of incidence data with the GENI score directly predicted increases in cases as the genome variation increased that led to new variants. Integrating the outbreak curve, dynamic R, and SNP variation found a direct association between increasing cases and transmission genome evolution. By defining the epidemic curve into four stages and integrating the instantaneous country-specific R with the GENI score, we directly connected changes in individual outbreaks based on changes in the virus genome via SNPs. This resulted in the ability to forecast potential increases in cases as well as mutations that may defeat PCR screening and the infection process. By using instantaneous R estimations and WGS, outbreak dynamics were defined to be linked to viral mutations, indicating that WGS, as a surveillance tool, is required to predict shifts in each outbreak that will provide actionable decision making information. Integrating epidemiology with genome sequencing and modeling allows for evidence-based disease outbreak tracking with predictive therapeutically valuable insights in near real time.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Cellular heterogeneity is regarded as a major factor for treatment response and resistance in a variety of malignant tumors, including malignant melanoma. More recent developments of single-cell sequencing technology provided deeper insights into this phenomenon. Single-cell data were used to identify prognostic subtypes of melanoma tumors, with a special emphasis on immune cells and fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, treatment resistance to checkpoint inhibitor therapy has been shown to be associated with a set of differentially expressed immune cell signatures unraveling new targetable intracellular signaling pathways. Characterization of T cell states under checkpoint inhibitor treatment showed that exhausted CD8+ T cell types in melanoma lesions still have a high proliferative index. Other studies identified treatment resistance mechanisms to targeted treatment against the mutated BRAF serine/threonine protein kinase including repression of the melanoma differentiation gene microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and induction of AXL receptor tyrosine kinase. Interestingly, treatment resistance mechanisms not only included selection processes of pre-existing subclones but also transition between different states of gene expression. Taken together, single-cell technology has provided deeper insights into melanoma biology and has put forward our understanding of the role of tumor heterogeneity and transcriptional plasticity, which may impact on innovative clinical trial designs and experimental approaches.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Traditional bulk analysis can only provide average variant allele frequencies of the targeted genes across all sampled cells. It fails to resolve mutational co-occurrences and may miss rare cancer cells. Genome analysis at the single cell level offers the opportunity to more fully resolve clonal architecture. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were sampled from acute myeloid leukemia patients longitudinally and single-cell DNA sequencing libraries were generated with a novel droplet-based microfluidics approach. Molecular profiling of single nucleotide variants across thousands of cells revealed genetic chimerism in patients after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Importantly, hierarchical clustering analysis of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) uncovered a distinct oncogenic clone of cells carrying mutated tumor-suppressor and/or oncogene(s). This novel single-cell DNA sequencing approach enabled precise monitoring of engraftment and revealed clonal evolution of oncogenic cells during the progression and treatment of the disease.},

abstract = {The conversion of the raw intensities obtained from next-generation sequencing platforms into nucleotide sequences with well-calibrated quality scores is a critical step in the generation of good sequence data. While recent model-based approaches can yield highly accurate calls, they require a substantial amount of processing time and/or computational resources. We previously introduced Ibis, a fast and accurate basecaller for the Illumina platform. We have continued active development of Ibis to take into account developments in the Illumina technology, as well as to make Ibis fully open source. We introduce here freeIbis, which offers significant improvements in sequence accuracy owing to the use of a novel multiclass support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. Sequence quality scores are now calibrated based on empirically observed scores, thus providing a high correlation to their respective error rates. These improvements result in downstream advantages including improved genotyping accuracy. FreeIbis is freely available for use under the GPL (http://bioinf.eva.mpg.de/freeibis/). It requires a Python interpreter and a C++ compiler. Tailored versions of LIBOCAS and LIBLINEAR are distributed along with the package.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The process of producing microarray data involves multiple steps, some of which may suffer from technical problems and seriously damage the quality of the data. Thus, it is essential to identify those arrays with low quality. This article addresses two questions: (1) how to assess the quality of a microarray dataset using the measures provided in quality control (QC) reports; (2) how to identify possible sources of the quality problems.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We propose a novel multivariate approach to evaluate the quality of an array that examines the 'Mahalanobis distance' of its quality attributes from those of other arrays. Thus, we call it Mahalanobis Distance Quality Control (MDQC) and examine different approaches of this method. MDQC flags problematic arrays based on the idea of outlier detection, i.e. it flags those arrays whose quality attributes jointly depart from those of the bulk of the data. Using two case studies, we show that a multivariate analysis gives substantially richer information than analyzing each parameter of the QC report in isolation. Moreover, once the QC report is produced, our quality assessment method is computationally inexpensive and the results can be easily visualized and interpreted. Finally, we show that computing these distances on subsets of the quality measures in the report may increase the method's ability to detect unusual arrays and helps to identify possible reasons of the quality problems.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: The library to implement MDQC will soon be available from Bioconductor.},

abstract = {Single cell gene expression profiling can be used to quantify transcriptional dynamics in temporal processes, such as cell differentiation, using computational methods to label each cell with a ‘pseudotime' where true time series experimentation is too difficult to perform. However, owing to the high variability in gene expression between individual cells, there is an inherent uncertainty in the precise temporal ordering of the cells. Pre-existing methods for pseudotime estimation have predominantly given point estimates precluding a rigorous analysis of the implications of uncertainty. We use probabilistic modelling techniques to quantify pseudotime uncertainty and propagate this into downstream differential expression analysis. We demonstrate that reliance on a point estimate of pseudotime can lead to inflated false discovery rates and that probabilistic approaches provide greater robustness and measures of the temporal resolution that can be obtained from pseudotime inference.},

abstract = {Background: Efficacy of vaccines studied in clinical trial settings are likely to be different from their effectiveness in a real-world scenario. Indian Armed Forces launched its vaccine drive against COVID-19 on 16 Jan 2021. This study evaluated the effect of vaccination on mortality amongst hospitalized COVID patients. Methods: A cross sectional study was done on all admitted moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at a designated COVID hospital in New Delhi. The primary outcome assessed the association of being fully vaccinated with mortality. Unadjusted odds ratios (OR) (with 95{\%} CI) was performed for each predictor. Logistic regression was used for multivariable analysis and adjusted odds ratios obtained. Results: The 1168 patients included in the study had a male preponderance with a mean age of 54.6 (± 17.51) years. A total of 266 (23{\%}) patients were partially vaccinated with COVISHIELD{\textregistered} and 184 (16{\%}) were fully vaccinated. Overall, 518 (44.3{\%}) patients had comorbidities and 332 (28.4{\%}) died. Among those fully vaccinated, there was 12.5{\%} (23/184) mortality while it was 31.45 {\%} (309/984) among the unvaccinated (OR 0.3, 95{\%} CI 0.2 to 0.5, p{\textless}0.0001). In a logistic regression model, complete vaccination status and younger age were found to be associated with survival. Conclusions: Vaccination with two doses of COVISHIELD{\textregistered} was associated with lower odds of mortality among hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID.},

For example, heavy alcohol consumption can cause generalized suppression of blood cell production and the production of structurally abnormal blood cell precursors that cannot mature into functional cells. Alcoholics frequently have defective red blood cells that are destroyed prematurely, possibly resulting in anemia. Alcohol also interferes with the production and function of white blood cells, especially those that defend the body against invading bacteria. Consequently, alcoholics frequently suffer from bacterial infections. Finally, alcohol adversely affects the platelets and other components of the blood-clotting system.

abstract = {Purpose: The incidence of malignant melanoma is increasing worldwide in fair-skinned populations. Melanomas respond poorly to systemic therapy, and metastatic melanomas inevitably become fatal. Although spontaneous regression, likely due to immune defense activation, rarely occurs, we lack a biological rationale and predictive markers in selecting patients for immune therapy. Experimental Design: We performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering of global gene expression data from stage IV melanomas in 57 patients. For further characterization, we used immunohistochemistry of selected markers, genome-wide DNA copy number analysis, genetic and epigenetic analysis of the CDKN2A locus, and NRAS/BRAF mutation screening. Results: The analysis revealed four distinct subtypes with gene signatures characterized by expression of immune response, pigmentation differentiation, proliferation, or stromal composition genes. Although all subtypes harbored NRAS and BRAF mutations, there was a significant difference between subtypes (P {\textless} 0.01), with no BRAF/NRAS wild-type samples in the proliferative subtype. Additionally, the proliferative subtype was characterized by a high frequency of CDKN2A homozygous deletions (P {\textless} 0.01). We observed a different prognosis between the subtypes (P = 0.01), with a particularly poor survival for patients harboring tumors of the proliferative subtype compared with the others (P = 0.003). Importantly, the clinical relevance of the subtypes was validated in an independent cohort of 44 stage III and IV melanomas. Moreover, low expression of an a priori defined gene set associated with immune response signaling was significantly associated with poor outcome (P = 0.001). Conclusions: Our data reveal a biologically based taxonomy of malignant melanomas with prognostic effect and support an influence of the antitumoral immune response on outcome. {\textcopyright}2010 AACR.},

abstract = {The self-organizing maps portraying has been proven to be a powerful approach for analysis of transcriptomic, genomic, epigenetic, single-cell, and pathway-level data as well as for “multi-omic” integrative analyses. However, the SOM method has a major disadvantage: it requires the retraining of the entire dataset once a new sample is added, which can be resource- and time-demanding. It also shifts the gene landscape, thus complicating the interpretation and comparison of results. To overcome this issue, we have developed two approaches of transfer learning that allow for extending SOM space with new samples, meanwhile preserving its intrinsic structure. The extension SOM (exSOM) approach is based on adding secondary data to the existing SOM space by “meta-gene adaptation”, while supervised SOM portrayal (supSOM) adds support vector machine regression model on top of the original SOM algorithm to “predict” the portrait of a new sample. Both methods have been shown to accurately combine existing and new data. With simulated data, exSOM outperforms supSOM for accuracy, while supSOM significantly reduces the computing time and outperforms exSOM for this parameter. Analysis of real datasets demonstrated the validity of the projection methods with independent datasets mapped on existing SOM space. Moreover, both methods well handle the projection of samples with new characteristics that were not present in training datasets.},

abstract = {Although most mutations in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome are expected to be either deleterious and swiftly purged or relatively neutral, a small proportion will affect functional properties and may alter infectivity, disease severity or interactions with host immunity. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 was followed by a period of relative evolutionary stasis lasting about 11 months. Since late 2020, however, SARS-CoV-2 evolution has been characterized by the emergence of sets of mutations, in the context of ‘variants of concern', that impact virus characteristics, including transmissibility and antigenicity, probably in response to the changing immune profile of the human population. There is emerging evidence of reduced neutralization of some SARS-CoV-2 variants by postvaccination serum; however, a greater understanding of correlates of protection is required to evaluate how this may impact vaccine effectiveness. Nonetheless, manufacturers are preparing platforms for a possible update of vaccine sequences, and it is crucial that surveillance of genetic and antigenic changes in the global virus population is done alongside experiments to elucidate the phenotypic impacts of mutations. In this Review, we summarize the literature on mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the primary antigen, focusing on their impacts on antigenicity and contextualizing them in the protein structure, and discuss them in the context of observed mutation frequencies in global sequence datasets.},

We present and validate a computational approach that uses latent variable models to account for such hidden factors. We show that our single-cell latent variable model (scLVM) allows the identification of otherwise undetectable subpopulations of cells that correspond to different stages during the differentiation of naive T cells into T helper 2 cells.

abstract = {Background: Even before the onset of age-related diseases, obesity might be a contributing factor to the cumulative burden of oxidative stress and chronic inflammation throughout the life course. Obesity may therefore contribute to accelerated shortening of telomeres. Consequently, obese persons are more likely to have shorter telomeres, but the association between body mass index (BMI) and leukocyte telomere length (TL) might differ across the life span and between ethnicities and sexes. Objective: A collaborative cross-sectionalmeta-analysis of observational studies was conducted to investigate the associations between BMI and TL across the life span. Design: Eighty-seven distinct study samples were included in the meta-analysis capturing data from 146,114 individuals. Studyspecific age- and sex-adjusted regression coefficients were combined by using a random-effects model in which absolute [base pairs (bp)] and relative telomere to single-copy gene ratio (T/S ratio) TLs were regressed against BMI. Stratified analysis was performed by 3 age categories ("young": 18-60 y; "middle": 61-75 y; and "old": {\textgreater}75 y), sex, and ethnicity. Results: Each unit increase in BMI corresponded to a-3.99 bp (95{\%} CI: -5.17, -2.81 bp) difference in TL in the total pooled sample; among young adults, each unit increase in BMI corresponded to a -7.67 bp (95{\%} CI:-10.03,-5.31 bp) difference. Each unit increase in BMI corresponded to a -1.58 × 10-3 unit T/S ratio (0.16{\%} decrease; 95{\%} CI: -2.14 × 10-3, -1.01 × 10-3) difference in ageand sex-adjusted relative TL in the total pooled sample; among young adults, each unit increase in BMI corresponded to a -2.58 × 10-3 unit T/S ratio (0.26{\%} decrease; 95{\%} CI: -3.92 × 10-3, -1.25 × 10-3). The associations were predominantly for the white pooled population. No sex differences were observed. Conclusions: A higher BMI is associated with shorter telomeres, especially in younger individuals. The presently observed difference is not negligible.

abstract = {Our study addresses modes of genomic regulation and their characterization using the distribution of expression values. A simple model of transcriptional regulation is introduced to characterize the response of the global expression pattern to the changing properties of basal regulatory building blocks. Random genomes are generated which express and bind transcription factors according to the appearance of short motifs of coding and binding sequences. Regulation of transcriptional activity is described using a thermodynamic model. Our model predicts single-peaked distributions of expression values the flanks of which decay according to power laws. The characteristic exponent is inversely related to the product of the connectivity of the network times the regulatory strength of bound transcription factors. Such 'expression spectra' were calculated and analyzed for different model genomes. Information on structural properties and on the interactions of regulatory elements is used to build up a framework of basic characteristics of expression spectra. We analyze examples addressing different biological issues. Peak position and width of the experimental expression spectra vary with the biological context. We demonstrate that the study of the global expression pattern provides valuable information about transcriptional regulation which complements conventional searches for differentially expressed single genes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Results: We identified regulatory modules of coexpressed and comethylated genes in high-grade gliomas: two modes are governed by genes hypermethylated and underexpressed in IDH-mutated cases, while two other modes reflect immune and stromal signatures in the classical and mesenchymal subtypes. A fifth mode with proneural characteristics comprises genes of repressed and poised chromatin states active in healthy brain. Two additional modes enrich genes either in active or repressed chromatin states. Conclusion: The method disentangles the interplay between gene expression and methylation.

abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders with high heritability, yet a majority of genetic contribution to pathophysiology is not known. Siblings of individuals with ASD are at increased risk for ASD and autistic traits, but the genetic contribution for simplex families is estimated to be less when compared to multiplex families. To explore the genomic (dis-) similarity between proband and unaffected sibling in simplex families, we used genome-wide gene expression profiles of blood from 20 proband-unaffected sibling pairs and 18 unrelated control individuals. The global gene expression profiles of unaffected siblings were more similar to those from probands as they shared genetic and environmental background. A total of 189 genes were significantly differentially expressed between proband-sib pairs (nominal p {\textless} 0.01) after controlling for age, sex, and family effects. Probands and siblings were distinguished into two groups by cluster analysis with these genes. Overall, unaffected siblings were equally distant from the centroid of probands and from that of unrelated controls with the differentially expressed genes. Interestingly, five of 20 siblings had gene expression profiles that were more similar to unrelated controls than to their matched probands. In summary, we found a set of genes that distinguished probands from the unaffected siblings, and a subgroup of unaffected siblings who were more similar to probands. The pathways that characterized probands compared to siblings using peripheral blood gene expression profiles were the up-regulation of ribosomal, spliceosomal, and mitochondrial pathways, and the down-regulation of neuroreceptor-ligand, immune response and calcium signaling pathways. Further integrative study with structural genetic variations such as de novo mutations, rare variants, and copy number variations would clarify whether these transcriptomic changes are structural or environmental in origin.},

abstract = {Intratumor heterogeneity is a common characteristic across diverse cancer types and presents challenges to current standards of treatment. Advancements in high-throughput sequencing and imaging technologies provide opportunities to identify and characterize these aspects of heterogeneity. Notably, transcriptomic profiling at a single-cell resolution enables quantitative measurements of the molecular activity that underlies the phenotypic diversity of cells within a tumor. Such high-dimensional data require computational analysis to extract relevant biological insights about the cell types and states that drive cancer development, pathogenesis, and clinical outcomes. In this review, we highlight emerging themes in the computational analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data and their applications to cancer research. We focus on downstream analytical challenges relevant to cancer research, including how to computationally perform unified analysis across many patients and disease states, distinguish neoplastic from nonneoplastic cells, infer communication with the tumor microenvironment, and delineate tumoral and microenvironmental evolution with trajectory and RNA velocity analysis. We include discussions of challenges and opportunities for future computational methodological advancements necessary to realize the translational potential of single-cell transcriptomic profiling in cancer.},

abstract = {Flatworms of the species Schmidtea mediterranea are immortal—adult animals contain a large pool of pluripotent stem cells that continuously differentiate into all adult cell types. Therefore, single-cell transcriptome profiling of adult animals should reveal mature and progenitor cells. By combining perturbation experiments, gene expression analysis, a computational method that predicts future cell states from transcriptional changes, and a lineage reconstruction method, we placed all major cell types onto a single lineage tree that connects all cells to a single stem cell compartment. We characterized gene expression changes during differentiation and discovered cell types important for regeneration. Our results demonstrate the importance of single-cell transcriptome analysis for mapping and reconstructing fundamental processes of developmental and regenerative biology at high resolution.},

abstract = {To study the pathogenic importance of the rheumatoid factor (RF) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to identify genes differentially expressed in patients and healthy individuals, total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from eight RF-positive and six RF-negative RA patients, and seven healthy controls. Gene expression of about 10,000 genes were examined using oligonucleotide-based DNA chip microarrays. The analyses showed no significant differences in PBMC expression patterns from RF-positive and RF-negative patients. However, comparisons of gene expression patterns from all fourteen RA patients and healthy controls identified a subset of discriminative genes. These results were validated by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on another group of RA patients and healthy controls. This confirmed that the following genes had a significantly higher expression in RA patients than in healthy controls: CD14 antigen, defensin ??-1 and ??-3 (DEFA), fatty-acid-Coenzyme A ligase, long-chain 2 (FACL), ribonuclease 2 (RNASE2), S100 calcium-binding protein A8 and A12 (S100A8 and S100A12). In contrast, the expression of MHC class II, DQ ??1 (HLA-DQB1) was significantly reduced in RA patients compared to healthy controls. Conclusions: With the analytical procedure employed, we did not find any indication that RF-positive and RF-negative RA are two fundamentally different diseases. Most of the genes discriminative between RA patients and healthy individuals are known to be involved in immunoinflammatory responses, especially those related to altered phagocytic functions. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Wirth2011,
abstract = {Background: Parallel high-throughput microarray and sequencing experiments produce vast quantities of multidimensional data which must be arranged and analyzed in a concerted way. One approach to addressing this challenge is the machine learning technique known as self organizing maps (SOMs). SOMs enable a parallel sample-and gene-centered view of genomic data combined with strong visualization and second-level analysis capabilities. The paper aims at bridging the gap between the potency of SOM-machine learning to reduce dimension of high-dimensional data on one hand and practical applications with special emphasis on gene expression analysis on the other hand. Results: The method was applied to generate a SOM characterizing the whole genome expression profiles of 67 healthy human tissues selected from ten tissue categories (adipose, endocrine, homeostasis, digestion, exocrine, epithelium, sexual reproduction, muscle, immune system and nervous tissues). SOM mapping reduces the dimension of expression data from ten of thousands of genes to a few thousand metagenes, each representing a minicluster of co-regulated single genes. Tissue-specific and common properties shared between groups of tissues emerge as a handful of localized spots in the tissue maps collecting groups of co-regulated and co-expressed metagenes. The functional context of the spots was discovered using overrepresentation analysis with respect to pre-defined gene sets of known functional impact. We found that tissue related spots typically contain enriched populations of genes related to specific molecular processes in the respective tissue. Analysis techniques normally used at the gene-level such as two-way hierarchical clustering are better represented and provide better signal-to-noise ratios if applied to the metagenes. Metagene-based clustering analyses aggregate the tissues broadly into three clusters containing nervous, immune system and the remaining tissues. Conclusions: The SOM technique provides a more intuitive and informative global view of the behavior of a few well-defined modules of correlated and differentially expressed genes than the separate discovery of the expression levels of hundreds or thousands of individual genes. The program is available as R-package 'oposSOM'.},

Here we demonstrate a simple procedure for the isolation of nucleosome-depleted DNA from human chromatin, termed FAIRE (Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements). To perform FAIRE, chromatin is crosslinked with formaldehyde in vivo, sheared by sonication, and phenol-chloroform extracted. The DNA recovered in the aqueous phase is fluorescently labeled and hybridized to a DNA microarray. FAIRE performed in human cells strongly enriches DNA coincident with the location of DNaseI hypersensitive sites, transcriptional start sites, and active promoters. Evidence for cell-type-specific patterns of FAIRE enrichment is also presented. FAIRE has utility as a positive selection for genomic regions associated with regulatory activity, including regions traditionally detected by nuclease hypersensitivity assays. {\textcopyright}2007 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

We investigated the association between TL and risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and cancer in OSA patients. We studied 210 individuals undergoing sleep-related studies between 2000 and 2007. Baseline characteristics and follow-up data (available in 164 subjects) were obtained from clinic records. Incidence rates were calculated for the entire group and by OSA status. Hazard ratios were calculated to estimate effects of OSA and TL on risk of MACE and cancer. In total, 32 individuals (20{\%}) developed MACE and/or cancer during 12.7-year follow-up. The OSA group had a higher likelihood of cancer (16.0 vs. 4.9 events per 1000 person-years, P = 0.044) but no clear evidence of an elevated incidence of MACE (10.8 vs. 4.8 events per 1000 person-years, P = 0.293) compared to the non-OSA group. There was no association between TL and MACE- (HR = 1.01, 95{\%} CI 0.78–1.28), or cancer-risk (HR = 1.18, 95{\%} CI 0.96–1.43).

We establish a framework for genomic classification into one of four subtypes based on the pattern of the most prevalent significantly mutated genes: mutant BRAF, mutant RAS, mutant NF1, and Triple-WT (wild-type). Integrative analysis reveals enrichment of KIT mutations and focal amplifications and complex structural rearrangements as a feature of the Triple-WT subtype. We found no significant outcome correlation with genomic classification, but samples assigned a transcriptomic subclass enriched for immune gene expression associated with lymphocyte infiltrate on pathology review and high LCK protein expression, a T cell marker, were associated with improved patient survival. This clinicopathological and multi-dimensional analysis suggests that the prognosis of melanoma patients with regional metastases is influenced by tumor stroma immunobiology, offering insights to further personalize therapeutic decision-making.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Throughout the past few years, a lively debate emerged about the timing and magnitude of the human migrations between the Iberian Peninsula and the Maghreb. Several pieces of evidence, including archaeological, anthropological, historical, and genetic data, have pointed to a complex and intermingled evolutionary history in the western Mediterranean area. To study to what extent connections across the Strait of Gibraltar and surrounding areas have shaped the present-day genomic diversity of its populations, we have performed a screening of 2.5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 142 samples from southern Spain, southern Portugal, and Morocco. We built comprehensive data sets of the studied area and we implemented multistep bioinformatic approaches to assess population structure, demographic histories, and admixture dynamics. Both local and global ancestry inference showed an internal substructure in the Iberian Peninsula, mainly linked to a differential African ancestry. Western Iberia, from southern Portugal to Galicia, constituted an independent cluster within Iberia characterized by an enriched African genomic input. Migration time modeling showed recent historic dates for the admixture events occurring both in Iberia and in the North of Africa. However, an integrative vision of both paleogenomic and modern DNA data allowed us to detect chronological transitions and population turnovers that could be the result of transcontinental migrations dating back from Neolithic times. The present contribution aimed to fill the gaps in the modern human genomic record of a key geographic area, where the Mediterranean and the Atlantic come together.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Purpose: The incidence of malignant melanoma is increasing worldwide in fair-skinned populations. Melanomas respond poorly to systemic therapy, and metastatic melanomas inevitably become fatal. Although spontaneous regression, likely due to immune defense activation, rarely occurs, we lack a biological rationale and predictive markers in selecting patients for immune therapy. Experimental Design: We performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering of global gene expression data from stage IV melanomas in 57 patients. For further characterization, we used immunohistochemistry of selected markers, genome-wide DNA copy number analysis, genetic and epigenetic analysis of the CDKN2A locus, and NRAS/BRAF mutation screening. Results: The analysis revealed four distinct subtypes with gene signatures characterized by expression of immune response, pigmentation differentiation, proliferation, or stromal composition genes. Although all subtypes harbored NRAS and BRAF mutations, there was a significant difference between subtypes (P {\textless} 0.01), with no BRAF/NRAS wild-type samples in the proliferative subtype. Additionally, the proliferative subtype was characterized by a high frequency of CDKN2A homozygous deletions (P {\textless} 0.01). We observed a different prognosis between the subtypes (P = 0.01), with a particularly poor survival for patients harboring tumors of the proliferative subtype compared with the others (P = 0.003). Importantly, the clinical relevance of the subtypes was validated in an independent cohort of 44 stage III and IV melanomas. Moreover, low expression of an a priori defined gene set associated with immune response signaling was significantly associated with poor outcome (P = 0.001). Conclusions: Our data reveal a biologically based taxonomy of malignant melanomas with prognostic effect and support an influence of the antitumoral immune response on outcome. {\textcopyright}2010 AACR.},

Planarian regeneration involves the generation of new tissue at the wound site via cell proliferation (blastema formation), and the remodeling of pre-existing tissues to restore symmetry and proportion (morphallaxis). Because blastemas do not replace all tissues following most types of injuries, both blastema formation and morphallaxis are needed for complete regeneration. Here we discuss a proliferative cell population, the neoblasts, that is central to the regenerative capacities of planarians. Neoblasts may be a totipotent stem-cell population capable of generating essentially every cell type in the adult animal, including themselves. The population properties of the neoblasts and their descendants still await careful elucidation. We identify the types of structures produced by blastemas on a variety of wound surfaces, the principles guiding the reorganization of pre-existing tissues, and the manner in which scale and cell number proportions between body regions are restored during regeneration.},

abstract = {Background: Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are one of the largest sources of new data in biology. In most papers, SNPs between individuals are visualized with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), an older method for this purpose. Principal Findings: We compare PCA, an aging method for this purpose, with a newer method, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) for the visualization of large SNP datasets. We also propose a set of key figures for evaluating these visualizations; in all of these t-SNE performs better. Significance: To transform data PCA remains a reasonably good method, but for visualization it should be replaced by a method from the subfield of dimension reduction. To evaluate the performance of visualization, we propose key figures of cross-validation with machine learning methods, as well as indices of cluster validity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Alexander Platzer.},

abstract = {Defining the transcriptional dynamics of a temporal process such as cell differentiation is challenging owing to the high variability in gene expression between individual cells. Time-series gene expression analyses of bulk cells have difficulty distinguishing early and late phases of a transcriptional cascade or identifying rare subpopulations of cells, and single-cell proteomic methods rely on a priori knowledge of key distinguishing markers. Here we describe Monocle, an unsupervised algorithm that increases the temporal resolution of transcriptome dynamics using single-cell RNA-Seq data collected at multiple time points. Applied to the differentiation of primary human myoblasts, Monocle revealed switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors, sequential waves of gene regulation, and expression of regulators that were not known to act in differentiation. We validated some of these predicted regulators in a loss-of function screen. Monocle can in principle be used to recover single-cell gene expression kinetics from a wide array of cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation and oncogenic transformation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Nature America, Inc.

Resolving cell cycle for such groups of cells is significant, but may not be adequately achieved by commonly used approaches. Here we develop a traveling salesman problem and hidden Markov model-based computational method named reCAT, to recover cell cycle along time for unsynchronized single-cell transcriptome data. We independently test reCAT for accuracy and reliability using several data sets. We find that cell cycle genes cluster into two major waves of expression, which correspond to the two well-known checkpoints, G1 and G2. Moreover, we leverage reCAT to exhibit methylation variation along the recovered cell cycle. Thus, reCAT shows the potential to elucidate diverse profiles of cell cycle, as well as other cyclic or circadian processes (e.g., in liver), on single-cell resolution.},

abstract = {We report the first local transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in mainland China. All 167 infections could be traced back to the first index case. Daily sequential PCR testing of the quarantined subjects indicated that the viral loads of Delta infections, when they first become PCR+, were on average ∼1000 times greater compared to A/B lineage infections during initial epidemic wave in China in early 2020, suggesting potentially faster viral replication and greater infectiousness of Delta during early infection. We performed high-quality sequencing on samples from 126 individuals. Reliable epidemiological data meant that, for 111 transmission events, the donor and recipient cases were known. The estimated transmission bottleneck size was 1-3 virions with most minor intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) failing to transmit to the recipients. However, transmission heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 was also observed. The transmission of minor iSNVs resulted in at least 4 of the 30 substitutions identified in the outbreak, highlighting the contribution of intra-host variants to population level viral diversity during rapid spread. Disease control activities, such as the frequency of population testing, quarantine during pre-symptomatic infection, and level of virus genomic surveillance should be adjusted in order to account for the increasing prevalence of the Delta variant worldwide.

The first step is to extract the fundamental patterns of gene expression inherent in the data. This paper describes the application of self-organizing maps, a type of mathematical cluster analysis that is particularly well suited for recognizing and classifying features in complex, multidimensional data. The method has been implemented in a publicly available computer package, GENECLUSTER, that performs the analytical calculations and provides easy data visualization. To illustrate the value of such analysis, the approach is applied to hematopoietic differentiation in four well studied models (HL-60, U937, Jurkat, and NB4 cells). Expression patterns of some 6,000 human genes were assayed, and an online database was created. GENECLUSTER was used to organize the genes into biologically relevant clusters that suggest novel hypotheses about hematopoietic differentiation--for example, highlighting certain genes and pathways involved in "differentiation therapy" used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia.},

abstract = {Purpose: For primary melanomas, tumor thickness, mitotic rate, and ulceration are well-laid corner-stones of prognostication. However, a molecular exposition of melanoma aggressiveness is critically missing. We recently uncovered a four-class structure in metastatic melanoma, which predicts outcome and informs biology. This raises the possibility that a molecular structure exists even in the early stages of melanoma and that molecular determinants could underlie histophenotype and eventual patient outcome. Experimental Design: We subjected 223 archival primary melanomas to a horizontally integrated analysis of RNA expression, oncogenic mutations at 238 lesions, histomorphometry, and survival data. Results: Our previously described four-class structure that was elucidated in metastatic lesions was evident within the expression space of primary melanomas. Because these subclasses converged into two larger prognostic and phenotypic groups, we used the metastatic lesions to develop a binary subtype-based signature capable of distinguishing between "high" and "low" grade forms of the disease. The two-grade signature was subsequently applied to the primary melanomas. Compared with low-grade tumors, high-grade primary melanomas were significantly associated with increased tumor thickness, mitotic rate, ulceration (all P {\textless} 0.01), and poorer relapse-free (HR = 4.94; 95{\%} CI, 2.84-8.59), and overall (HR = 3.66; 95{\%} CI, 2.40-5.58) survival. High-grade melanomas exhibited elevated levels of proliferation and BRCA1/DNA damage signaling genes, whereas low-grade lesions harbored higher expression of immune genes. Importantly, the molecular-grade signature was validated in two external gene expression data sets. Conclusions: We provide evidence for a molecular organization within melanomas, which is preserved across all stages of disease. {\textcopyright}2012 American Association for Cancer Research.},

abstract = {RNA velocity has opened up new ways of studying cellular differentiation in single-cell RNA-sequencing data. It describes the rate of gene expression change for an individual gene at a given time point based on the ratio of its spliced and unspliced messenger RNA (mRNA). However, errors in velocity estimates arise if the central assumptions of a common splicing rate and the observation of the full splicing dynamics with steady-state mRNA levels are violated. Here we present scVelo, a method that overcomes these limitations by solving the full transcriptional dynamics of splicing kinetics using a likelihood-based dynamical model. This generalizes RNA velocity to systems with transient cell states, which are common in development and in response to perturbations. We apply scVelo to disentangling subpopulation kinetics in neurogenesis and pancreatic endocrinogenesis. We infer gene-specific rates of transcription, splicing and degradation, recover each cell's position in the underlying differentiation processes and detect putative driver genes. scVelo will facilitate the study of lineage decisions and gene regulation.},

We generated detailed maps of the transcriptomes and DNA methylomes, revealing that cell functions divided into three major archetypic hallmarks: (i) increased proliferation in IDH-wt and, to a lesser degree, IDH-O; (ii) increased inflammation in IDH-A and IDH-wt; and (iii) the loss of synaptic transmis-sion in all subtypes. Immunogenic properties of IDH-A are diverse, partly resembling signatures observed in grade IV mesenchymal glioblastomas or in grade I pilocytic astrocytomas. We analyzed details of coregulation between gene expression and DNA methylation and of the immunogenic micro-environment presumably driving tumor development and treatment resistance. Our transcrip-tome and methylome maps support personalized, case-by-case views to decipher the heterogeneity of glioma states in terms of data portraits.

abstract = {Some of the key epigenetic regulatory mechanisms appeared early during evolution, and the acquisition of novel epigenetic regulators apparently facilitated certain evolutionary transitions. In this short review we focus mainly on the major epigenetic mechanisms that control chromatin structure and accessibility in mammalian cells. The enzymes methylating CpG dinucleotides and those involved in the active demethylation of 5-metylcytosine (5mC) are outlined together with the members of the methyl binding protein (MBP) family that bind to and “interpret” the 5mC mark. The enzymes involved in reversible, covalent modifications of core histone proteins that affect chromatin structure are also described briefly. Proteins that build up Polycomb group (PcG) and Trithorax group (TrxG) protein complexes may also modify histones. By establishing heritable chromatin states, PcG and TrxG complexes contribute - similarly to cytosine methylation - to the transmission of cell type-specifi c gene expression patterns from cell generation to cell generation.

As a main result, we found that the expression levels of nearly all enzymes become markedly disturbed in lymphoma, suggesting deregulation of large parts of the epigenetic machinery. We discuss the effect of DNA promoter methylation and of transcriptional activity in the context of mutated epigenetic modifiers such as EZH2 and MLL2. As another mechanism, we studied the coupling between the energy metabolism and epigenetics via metabolites that act as cofactors of JmjC-type demethylases. Our study results suggest that Burkitt's lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell Lymphoma differ by an imbalance of repressive and poised promoters, which is governed predominantly by the activity of methyltransferases and the underrepresentation of demethylases in this regulation. The data further suggest that coupling of epigenetics with the energy metabolism can also be an important factor in lymphomagenesis in the absence of direct mutations of genes in metabolic pathways. Understanding of epigenetic deregulation in lymphoma and possibly in cancers in general must go beyond simple schemes using only a few modes of regulation.},

Here, to search for such states and decipher their underlying gene regulatory network (GRN), we studied 10 melanoma cultures using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) as well as 26 additional cultures using bulk RNA-seq. Although each culture exhibited a unique transcriptome, we identified shared GRNs that underlie the extreme melanocytic and mesenchymal states and the intermediate state. This intermediate state is corroborated by a distinct chromatin landscape and is governed by the transcription factors SOX6, NFATC2, EGR3, ELF1 and ETV4. Single-cell migration assays confirmed the intermediate migratory phenotype of this state. Using time-series sampling of single cells after knockdown of SOX10, we unravelled the sequential and recurrent arrangement of GRNs during phenotype switching. Taken together, these analyses indicate that an intermediate state exists and is driven by a distinct and stable ‘mixed' GRN rather than being a symbiotic heterogeneous mix of cells.},

Scientists must rapidly share information to assess the nature of the threat and develop new medical countermeasures. Governments need the data to trace the extent of the outbreak, initiate public health responses, and coordinate access to medicines and vaccines. Recent outbreaks suggest, however, that the sharing of such data cannot be taken for granted-making the timely international exchange of virus data a vital global challenge. This article undertakes the first analysis of the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data as an innovative policy effort to promote the international sharing of genetic and associated influenza virus data. Based on more than 20 semi-structured interviews conducted with key in-formants in the international community, coupled with analysis of a wide range of primary and secondary sources, the article finds that the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data contributes to global health in at least five ways: (1) collating the most complete repository of high-quality influenza data in the world; (2) facilitating the rapid sharing of potentially pandemic virus information during recent outbreaks; (3) supporting the World Health Organization's biannual seasonal flu vaccine strain selection process; (4) developing informal mechanisms for conflict resolution around the sharing of virus data; and (5) building greater trust with several countries key to global pandemic preparedness.},

abstract = {Metagenomics (also Environmental Genomics, Ecogenomics or Community Genomics) is an emerging approach to studying microbial communities in the environment. This relatively new technique enables studies of organisms that are not easily cultured in a laboratory, thus differing from traditional microbiology that relies almost entirely on cultured organisms. Metagenomics technology thus holds the premise of new depths of understanding of microbes and, importantly, is a new tool for addressing biotechnological problems, without tedious cultivation efforts. DNA sequencing technology has already made a significant breakthrough, and generation of gigabase-pairs of microbial DNA sequences is not posing a challenge any longer. However, conceptual advances in microbial science will not only rely on the availability of innovative sequencing platforms, but also on sequence-independent tools for getting an insight into the functioning of microbial communities. This is an important issue, as we know that even the best annotations of genomes and metagenomes only create hypotheses of the functionality and substrate spectra of encoded proteins which require experimental testing by classical disciplines such as physiology and biochemistry. In this review, we address the following question, how to take advantage of, and how can we improve the, metagenomic technology for accommodating the needs of microbial biologists and enzymologists?},

In a longitudinal setting, we identified personal aging markers whose levels changed over a short time frame of 2–3 years. Further, we defined different types of aging patterns in different individuals, termed ‘ageotypes', on the basis of the types of molecular pathways that changed over time in a given individual.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Gene co-expression networks are increasingly used to explore the system-level functionality of genes. The network construction is conceptually straightforward: nodes represent genes and nodes are connected if the corresponding genes are significantly co-expressed across appropriately chosen tissue samples. In reality, it is tricky to define the connections between the nodes in such networks. An important question is whether it is biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary information (connected=1, unconnected=0). We describe a general framework for `soft' thresholding that assigns a connection weight to each gene pair. This leads us to define the notion of a weighted gene co-expression network. For soft thresholding we propose several adjacency functions that convert the co-expression measure to a connection weight. For determining the parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology criterion).We generalize the following important network concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence that they can be important for predicting the biological significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the `weighted' topological overlap measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive modules than its `unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard thresholding.We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Cancer is a heavy burden for humans across the world with high morbidity and mortality. Transcription factors including sex determining region Y (SRY)-related high-mobility group (HMG) box (SOX) proteins are thought to be involved in the regulation of specific biological processes. The deregulation of gene expression programs can lead to cancer development. Here, we review the role of the SOX family in breast cancer, prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, thyroid cancer, brain tumours, gastrointestinal and lung tumours as well as the entailing therapeutic implications. The SOX family consists of more than 20 members that mediate DNA binding by the HMG domain and have regulatory functions in development, cell-fate decision, and differentiation. SOX2, SOX4, SOX5, SOX8, SOX9, and SOX18 are up-regulated in different cancer types and have been found to be associated with poor prognosis, while the up-regulation of SOX11 and SOX30 appears to be favourable for the outcome in other cancer types. SOX2, SOX4, SOX5 and other SOX members are involved in tumorigenesis, e.g. SOX2 is markedly up-regulated in chemotherapy resistant cells. The SoxF family (SOX7, SOX17, SOX18) plays an important role in angio- and lymphangiogenesis, with SOX18 seemingly being an attractive target for anti-angiogenic therapy and the treatment of metastatic disease in cancer. In summary, SOX transcription factors play an important role in cancer progression, including tumorigenesis, changes in the tumour microenvironment, and metastasis. Certain SOX proteins are potential molecular markers for cancer prognosis and putative potential therapeutic targets, but further investigations are required to understand their physiological functions.},

abstract = {Epithelial tissues, such as the skin, rely on cellular plasticity of stem cells (SCs) from different niches to restore tissue function after injury. How these molecularly and functionally diverse SC populations respond to injury remains elusive. Here, we genetically labeled Lgr5- or Lgr6-expressing cells from the hair follicle bulge and interfollicular epidermis (IFE), respectively, and monitored their individual transcriptional adaptations during wound healing using single-cell transcriptomics. Both Lgr5 and Lgr6 progeny rapidly induced a genetic wound signature that, for Lgr5 progeny, included the remodeling of receptors to permit interactions with the wound environment, a property that Lgr6 progeny possessed even before wounding. When contributing to re-epithelialization, Lgr5 progeny gradually replaced their bulge identity with an IFE identity, and this process started already before Lgr5 progeny left the bulge. Altogether, this study reveals how different SCs respond and adapt to a new environment, potentially explaining cellular plasticity of many epithelial tissues. Joost et al. elucidate how skin stem cells from different niches respond upon injury. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed that Lgr5 and Lgr6 progeny molecularly converge during wound healing. Instant cell adaptations of Lgr5 cells within their original niche permit interactions with the wound environment, an ability Lgr6 cells already possess before wounding.},

abstract = {Determine age-specific infection fatality rates for COVID-19 to inform public health policies and communications that help protect vulnerable age groups. Studies of COVID-19 prevalence were collected by conducting an online search of published articles, preprints, and government reports that were publicly disseminated prior to 18 September 2020. The systematic review encompassed 113 studies, of which 27 studies (covering 34 geographical locations) satisfied the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Age-specific IFRs were computed using the prevalence data in conjunction with reported fatalities 4 weeks after the midpoint date of the study, reflecting typical lags in fatalities and reporting. Meta-regression procedures in Stata were used to analyze the infection fatality rate (IFR) by age. Our analysis finds a exponential relationship between age and IFR for COVID-19. The estimated age-specific IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002{\%} at age 10 and 0.01{\%} at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4{\%} at age 55, 1.4{\%} at age 65, 4.6{\%} at age 75, and 15{\%} at age 85. Moreover, our results indicate that about 90{\%} of the variation in population IFR across geographical locations reflects differences in the age composition of the population and the extent to which relatively vulnerable age groups were exposed to the virus. These results indicate that COVID-19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom the infection fatality rate is two orders of magnitude greater than the annualized risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza. Moreover, the overall IFR for COVID-19 should not be viewed as a fixed parameter but as intrinsically linked to the age-specific pattern of infections. Consequently, public health measures to mitigate infections in older adults could substantially decrease total deaths.},

In mouse melanomas, both CD34þp75 (CD34þ) and CD34p75 (CD34) tumor subpopulations were characterized as melanoma-propagating cells (MPC) that exhibit some of those key features. However, these two subpopulations differ from each other in tumorigenic potential, ability to recapitulate heterogeneity, and chemoresistance. In this study, we demonstrate that CD34þ and CD34 subpopulations carrying the BRAFV600E mutation confer differential sensitivity to targeted BRAF inhibition. Through elevated KDM5B expression, melanoma cells shift toward a more drug-tolerant, CD34 state upon exposure to BRAF inhibitor or combined BRAF inhibitor and MEK inhibitor treatment. KDM5B loss or inhibition shifts melanoma cells to the more BRAF inhibitor–sensitive CD34þ state. These results support that KDM5B is a critical epigenetic regulator that governs the transition of key MPC subpopulations with distinct drug sensitivity. This study also emphasizes the importance of continuing to advance our understanding of intratumor heterogeneity and ultimately develop novel therapeutics by altering the heterogeneous characteristics of melanoma.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a new causative agent of chronic hepatitis in solid organ transplant recipients. Clinical studies suggest that the occurrence and persistence of chronic HEV infection are related to the immunological status of patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We used whole-genome microarray and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to compare the transcriptional profiles of whole blood from 8 kidney transplant recipients with chronic HEV infection and 8 matched kidney transplant recipients without HEV infection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We found that 30 genes in HEV-infected patients were upregulated, compared with those in control patients, as determined by microarray analysis. In contrast, no genes were downregulated. The 30 upregulated genes included 25 interferon-stimulated genes. Increased expression of the genes that encode IFIT1, IFI44L, RSAD2, EPSTI1, and ISG15 was confirmed by qRT-PCR. Interestingly, the expression levels of these genes were associated with the persistence of HEV infection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes may favor the persistence of an HEV infection. Whether the expression of interferon-stimulated genes is a marker of ongoing viremia or independent prognostic marker of HEV clearance needs further investigations.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Single-cell RNA sequencing has become a standard technique to characterize tissue development. Hereby, cross-sectional snapshots of the diversity of cell transcriptomes were transformed into (pseudo-) longitudinal trajectories of cell differentiation using computational methods, which are based on similarity measures distinguishing cell phenotypes. Cell development is driven by alterations of transcriptional programs e.g., by differentiation from stem cells into various tissues or by adapting to micro-environmental requirements. We here complement developmental trajectories in cell-state space by trajectories in gene-state space to more clearly address this latter aspect. Such trajectories can be generated using self-organizing maps machine learning. The method transforms multidimensional gene expression patterns into two dimensional data landscapes, which resemble the metaphoric Waddington epigenetic landscape. Trajectories in this landscape visualize transcriptional programs passed by cells along their developmental paths from stem cells to differentiated tissues. In addition, we generated developmental “vector fields” using RNA-velocities to forecast changes of RNA abundance in the expression landscapes. We applied the method to tissue development of planarian as an illustrative example. Gene-state space trajectories complement our data portrayal approach by (pseudo-)temporal information about changing transcriptional programs of the cells. Future applications can be seen in the fields of tissue and cell differentiation, ageing and tumor progression and also, using other data types such as genome, methylome, and also clinical and epidemiological phenotype data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The positioning of nucleosomes with respect to DNA plays an important role in regulating transcription. However, nucleosome mapping has been performed for only limited genomic regions in humans. We have generated genome-wide maps of nucleosome positions in both resting and activated human CD4+ T cells by direct sequencing of nucleosome ends using the Solexa high-throughput sequencing technique. We find that nucleosome phasing relative to the transcription start sites is directly correlated to RNA polymerase II (Pol II) binding. Furthermore, the first nucleosome downstream of a start site exhibits differential positioning in active and silent genes. TCR signaling induces extensive nucleosome reorganization in promoters and enhancers to allow transcriptional activation or repression. Our results suggest that H2A.Z-containing and modified nucleosomes are preferentially lost from the -1 nucleosome position. Our data provide a comprehensive view of the nucleosome landscape and its dynamic regulation in the human genome. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Analyses examined gender ratios for prevalence rates and the direction of changes in prevalence rates across age groups.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFINDINGS: Drinking per se and high-volume drinking were consistently more prevalent among men than among women, but lifetime abstention from alcohol was consistently more prevalent among women. Among respondents who had ever been drinkers, women in all age groups were consistently more likely to have stopped drinking than men were. Among drinkers, the prevalence of high-frequency drinking was consistently greatest in the oldest age group, particularly among men. Unexpectedly, the prevalence of drinking per se did not decline consistently with increasing age, and declines in high-volume and heavy episodic drinking with increasing age were more typical in Europe and English-speaking countries.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: As expected, men still exceed women in drinking and high-volume drinking, although gender ratios vary.

abstract = {Motivation: Pooling multiple samples increases the efficiency and lowers the cost of DNA sequencing. One approach to multiplexing is to use short DNA indices to uniquely identify each sample. After sequencing, reads must be assigned in silico to the sample of origin, a process referred to as demultiplexing. Demultiplexing software typically identifies the sample of origin using a fixed number of mismatches between the read index and a reference index set. This approach may fail or misassign reads when the sequencing quality of the indices is poor. Results: We introduce deML, a maximum likelihood algorithm that demultiplexes Illumina sequences. deML computes the likelihood of an observed index sequence being derived from a specified sample. A quality score which reflects the probability of the assignment being correct is generated for each read. Using these quality scores, even very problematic datasets can be demultiplexed and an error threshold can be set.},

abstract = {It is generally accepted that epigenetic modifications, such as DNA and histone methylations, affect transcription and that a gene's transcription feeds back on its epigenetic profile. Depending on the epigenetic modification, positive and negative feedback loops have been described. Here, we study whether such interrelation are mandatory and how transcription factor networks affect it. We apply self-organizing map machine learning to a published data set on the specification and differentiation of murine intestinal stem cells in order to provide an integrative view of gene transcription and DNA, as well as histone methylation during this process. We show that, although gain/loss of H3K4me3 at a gene promoter is generally considered to be associated with its increased/decreased transcriptional activity, such an interrelation is not mandatory, i.e., changes of the modification level do not necessarily affect transcription. Similar considerations hold for H3K27me3. In addition, even strong changes in the transcription of a gene do not necessarily affect its H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modification profile. We provide a mechanistic explanation of these phenomena that is based on a model of epigenetic regulation of transcription. Thereby, the analyzed data suggest a broad variance in gene specific regulation of histone methylation and support the assumption of an independent regulation of transcription by histone methylation and transcription factor networks. The results provide insights into basic principles of the specification of tissue stem cells and highlight open questions about a mechanistic modeling of this process.},

abstract = {Little is known about the mechanisms converting psychosocial stress into cellular dysfunction. Various genes, up-regulated in atherosclerosis but also by psychosocial stress, are controlled by the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). Therefore, NF-kappaB is a good candidate to convert psychosocial stress into cellular activation. Volunteers were subjected to a brief laboratory stress test and NF-kappaB activity was determined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), as a window into the body and because PBMC play a role in diseases such as atherosclerosis. In 17 of 19 volunteers, NF-kappaB was rapidly induced during stress exposure, in parallel with elevated levels of catecholamines and cortisol, and returned to basal levels within 60 min. To model this response, mice transgenic for a strictly NF-kappaB-controlled beta-globin transgene were stressed by immobilization. Immobilization resulted in increased beta-globin expression, which could be reduced in the presence of the alpha1-adrenergic inhibitor prazosin. To define the role of adrenergic stimulation in the up-regulation of NF-kappaB, THP-1 cells were induced with physiological amounts of catecholamines for 10 min. Only noradrenaline resulted in a dose- and time-dependent induction of NF-kappaB and NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression, which depended on pertussis-toxin-sensitive G protein-mediated phosphophatidylinositol 3-kinase, Ras/Raf, and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Induction was reduced by alpha(1)- and beta-adrenergic inhibitors. Thus, noradrenaline-dependent adrenergic stimulation results in activation of NF-kappaB in vitro and in vivo. Activation of NF-kappaB represents a downstream effector for the neuroendocrine response to stressful psychosocial events and links changes in the activity of the neuroendocrine axis to the cellular response.},

abstract = {Many health conditions, ranging from psychiatric disorders to cardiovascular disease, display notable seasonal variation in severity and onset. In order to understand the molecular processes underlying this phenomenon, we have examined seasonal variation in the transcriptome of 606 healthy individuals. We show that 74 transcripts associated with a 12-month seasonal cycle were enriched for processes involved in DNA repair and binding. An additional 94 transcripts demonstrated significant seasonal variability that was largely influenced by blood cell count levels. These transcripts were enriched for immune function, protein production, and specific cellular markers for lymphocytes. Accordingly, cell counts for erythrocytes, platelets, neutrophils, monocytes, and CD19 cells demonstrated significant association with a 12-month seasonal cycle. These results demonstrate that seasonal variation is an important environmental regulator of gene expression and blood cell composition. Notable changes in leukocyte counts and genes involved in immune function indicate that immune cell physiology varies throughout the year in healthy individuals.},

abstract = {Background {\&} objectives: SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) is evolving with the progression of the pandemic. This study was aimed to investigate the diversity and evolution of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 with progression of the pandemic over time and to identify similarities and differences of viral diversity and evolution across geographical regions (countries). Methods: Publicly available data on type definitions based on whole-genome sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 sampled during December and March 2020 from 3636 infected patients spread over 55 countries were collected. Phylodynamic analyses were performed and the temporal and spatial evolution of the virus was examined. Results: It was found that (i) temporal variation in frequencies of types of the coronavirus was significant; ancestral viruses of type O were replaced by evolved viruses belonging to type A2a; (ii) spatial variation was not significant; with the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the dominant virus was the A2a type virus in every geographical region; (iii) within a geographical region, there was significant micro-level variation in the frequencies of the different viral types, and (iv) the evolved coronavirus of type A2a swept rapidly across all continents. Interpretation {\&} conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 belonging to the A2a type possesses a non-synomymous variant (D614G) that possibly eases the entry of the virus into the lung cells of the host. This may be the reason why the A2a type has an advantage to infect and survive and as a result has rapidly swept all geographical regions. Therefore, large-scale sequencing of coronavirus genomes and, as required, of host genomes should be undertaken in India to identify regional and ethnic variation in viral composition and its interaction with host genomes. Further, careful collection of clinical and immunological data of the host can provide deep learning in relation to infection and transmission of the types of coronavirus genomes.

We surveyed variation in gene expression patterns in peripheral blood from 75 healthy volunteers by using cDNA microarrays. Characterization of the variation in gene expression in healthy tissue is an essential foundation for the recognition and interpretation of the changes in these patterns associated with infections and other diseases, and peripheral blood was selected because it is a uniquely accessible tissue in which to examine this variation in patients or healthy volunteers in a clinical setting. Specific features of interindividual variation in gene expression patterns in peripheral blood could be traced to variation in the relative proportions of specific blood cell subsets; other features were correlated with gender, age, and the time of day at which the sample was taken. An analysis of multiple sequential samples from the same individuals allowed us to discern donor-specific patterns of gene expression. These data help to define human individuality and provide a database with which disease-associated gene expression patterns can be compared.},

Many microarray studies are designed to detect genes associated with different phenotypes, for example, the comparison of cancer tumors and normal cells. In some multifactor experiments, genetic networks are perturbed with various treatments to understand the effects of those treatments and their interactions with each other in the dynamic cellular network. For even the simplest experiments, investigators must consider several issues for appropriate gene selection. We discuss strategies for geneat-a-time analyses, nonspecific and meta-data driven prefiltering techniques, and commonly used test statistics for detecting differential expression. We show how these strategies and statistical tools are implemented and used in Bioconductor. We also demonstrate the use of factorial models for probing complex biological systems and highlight the importance of carefully coordinating known cellular behavior with statistical modeling to make biologically relevant inference from microarray studies.},

We generated data for 66,783 cells, defining transcriptomes for known and many previously unknown planarian cell types and for putative transition states between stem and differentiated cells. We also uncovered regionally expressed genes in muscle, which harbors positional information. Identifying the transcriptomes for potentially all cell types for many organisms should be readily attainable and represents a powerful approach to metazoan biology.},

We implement an R package, UNsupervised DecOnvolution (UNDO), that can be used to automatically detect cell-specific marker genes (MGs) located on the scatter radii of mixed gene expressions, estimate cellular proportions in each sample and deconvolute mixed expressions into cell-specific expression profiles. We demonstrate the performance of UNDO over a wide range of tumor-stroma mixing proportions, validate UNDO on various biologically mixed benchmark gene expression datasets and further estimate tumor purity in TCGA/CPTAC datasets. The highly accurate deconvolution results obtained suggest not only the existence of cell-specific MGs but also UNDO's ability to detect them blindly and correctly. Although the principal application here involves microarray gene expressions, our methodology can be readily applied to other types of quantitative molecular profiling data.

Therefore, it is not surprising that dysregulated and chronic NF-$\kappa$B signalling can have a profound impact on cellular homeostasis. Here we discuss NFKB1 (p105/p50), one of the five subunits of NF-$\kappa$B, widely implicated in carcinogenesis, in some cases driving cancer progression and in others acting as a tumour-suppressor. The complexity of the role of this subunit lies in the multiple dimeric combination possibilities as well as the different interacting co-factors, which dictate whether gene transcription is activated or repressed, in a cell and organ-specific manner. This review highlights the multiple roles of NFKB1 in the development and progression of different cancers, and the considerations to make when attempting to manipulate NF-$\kappa$B as a potential cancer therapy.},

Understanding this diversity and its biological meaning requires a theoretical framework, which could in turn guide the development of more accurate prognosis and therapy. Here, we review the theory of multi-task evolution of cancer, which is based upon the premise that tumours evolve in the host and face selection trade-offs between multiple biological functions. This theory can help identify the major biological tasks that cancer cells perform and the trade-offs between these tasks. It introduces the concept of specialist tumours, which focus on one task, and generalist tumours, which perform several tasks. Specialist tumours are suggested to be sensitive to therapy targeting their main task. Driver mutations tune gene expression towards specific tasks in a tissue-dependent manner and thus help to determine whether a tumour is specialist or generalist. We discuss potential applications of the theory of multi-task evolution to interpret the spatial organization of tumours and intratumour heterogeneity.},

abstract = {The pluripotency-associated transcription factor SOX2 is essential during mammalian embryogenesis and later in life, but SOX2 expression can also be highly detrimental. Over the past 10 years, SOX2 has been shown to be expressed in at least 25 different cancers. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the roles of SOX2 in cancer and focuses on two broad topics. The first delves into the expression and function of SOX2 in cancer focusing on the connection between SOX2 levels and tumor grade as well as patient survival. As part of this discussion, we address the developing connection between SOX2 expression and tumor drug resistance. We also call attention to an under-appreciated property of SOX2, its levels in actively proliferating tumor cells appear to be optimized to maximize tumor growth - too little or too much SOX2 dramatically alters tumor growth. The second topic of this review focuses on the exquisite array of molecular mechanisms that control the expression and transcriptional activity of SOX2. In addition to its complex regulation at the transcriptional level, SOX2 expression and activity are controlled carefully by microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and post-translational modifications. In the Conclusion and Future Perspectives section, we point out that there are still important unanswered questions. Addressing these questions is expected to lead to new insights into the functions of SOX2 in cancer, which will help design novels strategies for more effectively treating some of the most deadly cancers.},

abstract = {Existing general definitions of beta diversity often produce a beta with a hidden dependence on alpha. Such a beta cannot be used to compare regions that differ in alpha diversity. To avoid misinterpretation, existing definitions of alpha and beta must be replaced by a definition that partitions diversity into independent alpha and beta components. Such a unique definition is derived here. When these new alpha and beta components are transformed into their numbers equivalents (effective numbers of elements), Whittaker's multiplicative law (alpha x = gamma) is necessarily true for all indices. The new beta gives the effective number of distinct communities. The most popular similarity and overlap measures of ecology (Jaccard, Sorensen, Horn, and Morisita-Horn indices) are monotonic transformations of the new beta diversity. Shannon measures follow deductively from this formalism and do not need to be borrowed from information theory; they are shown to be the only standard diversity measures which can be decomposed into meaningful independent alpha and beta components when community weights are unequal. {\textcopyright} 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diffuse lower WHO grade II and III gliomas (LGG) are slowly progressing brain tumors, many of which eventually transform into a more aggressive type. LGG is characterized by widespread genetic and transcriptional heterogeneity, yet little is known about the heterogeneity of the DNA methylome, its function in tumor biology, coupling with the transcriptome and tumor microenvironment and its possible impact for tumor development. METHODS: We here present novel DNA methylation data of an LGG-cohort collected in the German Glioma Network containing about 85{\%} isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutated tumors and performed a combined bioinformatics analysis using patient-matched genome and transcriptome data. RESULTS: Stratification of LGG based on gene expression and DNA-methylation provided four consensus subtypes. We characterized them in terms of genetic alterations, functional context, cellular composition, tumor microenvironment and their possible impact for treatment resistance and prognosis. Glioma with astrocytoma-resembling phenotypes constitute the largest fraction of nearly 60{\%}. They revealed largest diversity and were divided into four expression and three methylation groups which only partly match each other thus reflecting largely decoupled expression and methylation patterns. We identified a novel G-protein coupled receptor and a cancer-related 'keratinization' methylation signature in in addition to the glioma-CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP) signature. These different signatures overlap and combine in various ways giving rise to diverse methylation and expression patterns that shape the glioma phenotypes. The decrease of global methylation in astrocytoma-like LGG associates with higher WHO grade, age at diagnosis and inferior prognosis. We found analogies between astrocytoma-like LGG with grade IV IDH-wild type tumors regarding possible worsening of treatment resistance along a proneural-to-mesenchymal axis. Using gene signature-based inference we elucidated the impact of cellular composition of the tumors including immune cell bystanders such as macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: Genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic factors act in concert but partly also in a decoupled fashion what underpins the need for integrative, multidimensional stratification of LGG by combining these data on gene and cellular levels to delineate mechanisms of gene (de-)regulation and to enable better patient stratification and individualization of treatment.},

The principle of this method is to find pairs of operational taxonomic units (OTUs [= neighbors]) that minimize the total branch length at each stage of clustering of OTUs starting with a starlike tree. The branch lengths as well as the topology of a parsimonious tree can quickly be obtained by using this method. Using computer simulation, we studied the efficiency of this method in obtaining the correct unrooted tree in comparison with that of five other tree-making methods: the unweighted pair group method of analysis, Farris's method, Sattath and Tversky's method, Li's method, and Tateno et al.'s modified Farris method. The new, neighbor-joining method and Sattath and Tversky's method are shown to be generally better than the other methods.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Improved diagnostic tests for tuberculosis in children are needed. We hypothesized that transcriptional signatures of host blood could be used to distinguish tuberculosis from other diseases in African children who either were or were not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). METHODS The study population comprised prospective cohorts of children who were undergoing evaluation for suspected tuberculosis in South Africa (655 children), Malawi (701 children), and Kenya (1599 children). Patients were assigned to groups according to whether the diagnosis was culture-confirmed tuberculosis, culture-negative tuberculosis, diseases other than tuberculosis, or latent tuberculosis infection. Diagnostic signatures distinguishing tuberculosis from other diseases and from latent tuberculosis infection were identified from genomewide analysis of RNA expression in host blood. RESULTS We identified a 51-transcript signature distinguishing tuberculosis from other diseases in the South African and Malawian children (the discovery cohort). In the Kenyan children (the validation cohort), a risk score based on the signature for tuberculosis and for diseases other than tuberculosis showed a sensitivity of 82.9{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 68.6 to 94.3) and a specificity of 83.6{\%} (95{\%} CI, 74.6 to 92.7) for the diagnosis of culture-confirmed tuberculosis. Among patients with cultures negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis who were treated for tuberculosis (those with highly probable, probable, or possible cases of tuberculosis), the estimated sensitivity was 62.5 to 82.3{\%}, 42.1 to 80.8{\%}, and 35.3 to 79.6{\%}, respectively, for different estimates of actual tuberculosis in the groups. In comparison, the sensitivity of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for molecular detection of M. tuberculosis DNA in cases of culture-confirmed tuberculosis was 54.3{\%} (95{\%} CI, 37.1 to 68.6), and the sensitivity in highly probable, probable, or possible cases was an estimated 25.0 to 35.7{\%}, 5.3 to 13.3{\%}, and 0{\%}, respectively; the specificity of the assay was 100{\%}. CONCLUSIONS RNA expression signatures provided data that helped distinguish tuberculosis from other diseases in African children with and those without HIV infection.

abstract = {During early human pregnancy the uterine mucosa transforms into the decidua, into which the fetal placenta implants and where placental trophoblast cells intermingle and communicate with maternal cells. Trophoblast–decidual interactions underlie common diseases of pregnancy, including pre-eclampsia and stillbirth. Here we profile the transcriptomes of about 70,000 single cells from first-trimester placentas with matched maternal blood and decidual cells. The cellular composition of human decidua reveals subsets of perivascular and stromal cells that are located in distinct decidual layers. There are three major subsets of decidual natural killer cells that have distinctive immunomodulatory and chemokine profiles. We develop a repository of ligand–receptor complexes and a statistical tool to predict the cell-type specificity of cell–cell communication via these molecular interactions. Our data identify many regulatory interactions that prevent harmful innate or adaptive immune responses in this environment. Our single-cell atlas of the maternal–fetal interface reveals the cellular organization of the decidua and placenta, and the interactions that are critical for placentation and reproductive success.},

abstract = {Objective To assess the association between leucocyte telomere length and risk of cardiovascular disease. Design Systematic review and meta- Analysis. Data sources Studies published up to March 2014 identified through searches of Medline, Web of Science, and Embase. Eligibility criteria Prospective and retrospective studies that reported on associations between leucocyte telomere length and coronary heart disease (defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease death, or coronary revascularisation) or cerebrovascular disease (defined as non-fatal stroke or death from cerebrovascular disease) and were broadly representative of general populations- That is, they did not select cohort or control participants on the basis of pre-existing cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Results Twenty four studies involving 43 725 participants and 8400 patients with cardiovascular disease (5566 with coronary heart disease and 2834 with cerebrovascular disease) were found to be eligible. In a comparison of the shortest versus longest third of leucocyte telomere length, the pooled relative risk for coronary heart disease was 1.54 (95{\%} confidence interval 1.30 to 1.83) in all studies, 1.40 (1.15 to 1.70) in prospective studies, and 1.80 (1.32 to 2.44) in retrospective studies. Heterogeneity between studies was moderate (I2=64{\%}, 41{\%} to 77{\%}, Phet{\textless}0.001) and was not significantly explained by mean age of participants (P=0.23), the proportion of male participants (P=0.45), or distinction between retrospective versus prospective studies (P=0.32). Findings for coronary heart disease were similar in meta- Analyses restricted to studies that adjusted for conventional vascular risk factors (relative risk 1.42, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.17 to 1.73); studies with ≥200 cases (1.44, 1.20 to 1.74); studies with a high quality score (1.53, 1.22 to 1.92); and in analyses that corrected for publication bias (1.34, 1.12 to 1.60). The pooled relative risk for cerebrovascular disease was 1.42 (1.11 to 1.81), with no significant heterogeneity between studies (I2=41{\%}, 0{\%} to 72{\%}, P het=0.08). Shorter telomeres were not significantly associated with cerebrovascular disease risk in prospective studies (1.14, 0.85 to 1.54) or in studies with a high quality score (1.21, 0.83 to 1.76). Conclusion Available observational data show an inverse association between leucocyte telomere length and risk of coronary heart disease independent of conventional vascular risk factors. The association with cerebrovascular disease is less certain.},

abstract = {Background: It is widely believed that females have longer telomeres than males, although results from studies have been contradictory. Methods: We carried out a systematic review and meta-analyses to test the hypothesis that in humans, females have longer telomeres than males and that this association becomes stronger with increasing age. Searches were conducted in EMBASE and MEDLINE (by November 2009) and additional datasets were obtained from study investigators. Eligible observational studies measured telomeres for both females and males of any age, had a minimum sample size of 100 and included participants not part of a diseased group. We calculated summary estimates using random-effects meta-analyses. Heterogeneity between studies was investigated using sub-group analysis and meta-regression. Results: Meta-analyses from 36 cohorts (36,230 participants) showed that on average females had longer telomeres than males (standardised difference in telomere length between females and males 0.090, 95{\%} CI 0.015, 0.166; age-adjusted). There was little evidence that these associations varied by age group (p = 1.00) or cell type (p = 0.29). However, the size of this difference did vary by measurement methods, with only Southern blot but neither real-time PCR nor Flow-FISH showing a significant difference. This difference was not associated with random measurement error. Conclusions: Telomere length is longer in females than males, although this difference was not universally found in studies that did not use Southern blot methods. Further research on explanations for the methodological differences is required. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Objective— Moderate alcohol consumption has been postulated to be cardioprotective. Such an effect might be reflected in large-artery properties, such as arterial stiffness and wave reflections. Methods and Results— Three hundred seventy-one healthy postmenopausal women aged 50 to 74 years were sampled from a population-based study. Alcohol intake was calculated from a standardized questionnaire. Applanation tonometry was applied to assess the augmentation index and aortic pulse-wave velocity. Those drinking 1 to 3, 4 to 9, 10 to 14, and 15 to 35 glasses of alcoholic beverages per week had a 0.044 (95{\%} CI −0.47 to 0.56), −0.085 (95{\%} CI −0.59 to 0.43), −0.869 (95{\%} CI −1.44 to −0.29), and −0.225 (95{\%} CI −0.98 to 0.53) m/s difference in mean pulse-wave velocity compared with nondrinkers, respectively, which indicates a J-shaped relationship. Adjustment for potential confounders of pulse-wave velocity or alcohol intake did not materially change the strength of the association. Adjustment for HDL further attenuated the relationship. The augmentation index was not related to alcohol consumption when adjustments were made for physiological determinants such as age, height, and ejection duration. Conclusions— Among postmenopausal women, alcohol consumption is inversely associated with pulse-wave velocity. This supports the presence of a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease with moderate alcohol consumption, which may be mediated in part by HDL cholesterol.},

abstract = {Background Reports of waning vaccine-induced immunity against COVID-19 have begun to surface. With that, the comparable long-term protection conferred by previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear.

Methods We conducted a retrospective observational study comparing three groups: (1)SARS-CoV-2-na{\"{i}}ve individuals who received a two-dose regimen of the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine, (2)previously infected individuals who have not been vaccinated, and (3)previously infected and single dose vaccinated individuals. Three multivariate logistic regression models were applied. In all models we evaluated four outcomes: SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic disease, COVID-19-related hospitalization and death. The follow-up period of June 1 to August 14, 2021, when the Delta variant was dominant in Israel.

Results SARS-CoV-2-na{\"{i}}ve vaccinees had a 13.06-fold (95{\%} CI, 8.08 to 21.11) increased risk for breakthrough infection with the Delta variant compared to those previously infected, when the first event (infection or vaccination) occurred during January and February of 2021. The increased risk was significant ( P {\textless}0.001) for symptomatic disease as well. When allowing the infection to occur at any time before vaccination (from March 2020 to February 2021), evidence of waning natural immunity was demonstrated, though SARS-CoV-2 na{\"{i}}ve vaccinees had a 5.96-fold (95{\%} CI, 4.85 to 7.33) increased risk for breakthrough infection and a 7.13-fold (95{\%} CI, 5.51 to 9.21) increased risk for symptomatic disease. SARS-CoV-2-na{\"{i}}ve vaccinees were also at a greater risk for COVID-19-related-hospitalizations compared to those that were previously infected.

Conclusions This study demonstrated that natural immunity confers longer lasting and stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization caused by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, compared to the BNT162b2 two-dose vaccine-induced immunity. Individuals who were both previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and given a single dose of the vaccine gained additional protection against the Delta variant.

This study established reliable reference ranges for these platelet parameters while taking into consideration the effects of age and sex in a study population of 447 normal persons. There was an inverse, nonlinear relationship between MPV and platelet count, with no statistical difference (P greater than 0.05) seen between males and females. Platelet-crit showed no variation with respect to age or sex, however, a direct, linear relationship was suggested between PCT and platelet count. These relationships provide a better understanding of these platelet parameters and may contribute to their use as helpful diagnostic aids.},

abstract = {Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 provides essential information into viral evolution, transmission, and epidemiology. Short-read next-generation sequencing platforms are currently the gold-standard approaches characterized by the highest accuracy. Meanwhile, Oxford Nanopore's long-read sequencing devices show great promise, offering comparable accuracy, fast turnaround time, and reduced cost. In this study, we performed whole-genome sequencing and molecular-genetic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical specimens using an amplicon-based nanopore sequencing approach. Lineage and phylogenetic analysis identified the most prevalent lineages at different time points (B.1.1.163, B.1.1.208, B.1.1, and since March 2021 - B.1.1.7). In addition, we evaluated the possible effect of identified mutations on the efficacy of recommended primers and probes used for PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2. In summary, a high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome can be acquired by nanopore sequencing and it can serve as an efficient and affordable alternative to short-read next-generation sequencing and be used for epidemiologic surveillance and molecular-genetic analyses of the virus.

abstract = {There is tremendous scientific and clinical value to further improve the predictive power of autoantibodies as autoantibody-positive (AbP) children have heterogeneous rates of progression to clinical diabetes. This study explored the potential of using gene expression profiles as biomarkers for risk stratification among 104 AbP subjects from the Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY) using a discovery dataset based on microarray and a validation dataset based on Real-Time RT-PCR. Our microarray data identified 454 candidate genes with expression levels that are associated with different T1D progression rates. RT-PCR analyses of the top 27 candidate genes confirmed five genes (BACH2, IGLL3, EIF3A, CDC20 and TXNDC5) that are associated with differential progression and implicated in lymphocyte activation and function. Multivariate analyses of these five genes in the discovery and validation datasets identified and confirmed four multi-gene models (BI, ICE, BICE and BITE, each letter representing a gene) that consistently stratify high and low risk subsets of AbP subjects with hazard ratios (HR) greater than 6 (p {\textless} 0.01). These results suggest that these genes may be involved in T1D pathogenesis and potentially serve as excellent gene expression biomarkers to predict the risk of progression to clinical diabetes for AbP subjects.},

Much like pathologists who visually analyze information-rich histological sections as a whole, we propose here an integrative approach. We use a self-organizing maps-based software, the gene expression dynamics inspector (GEDI) to analyze gene expression profiles of various lung tumors. GEDI allows the comparison of tumor profiles based on direct visual detection of transcriptome patterns. Such intuitive "gestalt" perception promotes the discovery of interesting relationships in the absence of an existing hypothesis. We uncovered qualitative relationships between squamous cell tumors, small-cell tumors, and carcinoid tumor that would have escaped existing algorithmic classifications. These results suggest that GEDI may be a valuable explorative tool that combines global and gene-centered analyses of molecular profiles from large-scale microarray experiments.},

abstract = {Chromatin profiling has emerged as a powerful means of genome annotation and detection of regulatory activity. The approach is especially well suited to the characterization of non-coding portions of the genome, which critically contribute to cellular phenotypes yet remain largely uncharted. Here we map nine chromatin marks across nine cell types to systematically characterize regulatory elements, their cell-type specificities and their functional interactions. Focusing on cell-type-specific patterns of promoters and enhancers, we define multicell activity profiles for chromatin state, gene expression, regulatory motif enrichment and regulator expression. We use correlations between these profiles to link enhancers to putative target genes, and predict the cell-type-specific activators and repressors that modulate them. The resulting annotations and regulatory predictions have implications for the interpretation of genome-wide association studies. Top-scoring disease single nucleotide polymorphisms are frequently positioned within enhancer elements specifically active in relevant cell types, and in some cases affect a motif instance for a predicted regulator, thus suggesting a mechanism for the association. Our study presents a general framework for deciphering cis-regulatory connections and their roles in disease. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

However, these methods often generate multiplet artifacts, where two or more cells receive the same barcode, resulting in a hybrid transcriptome. In most experiments, multiplets account for several percent of transcriptomes and can confound downstream data analysis. Here, we present Single-Cell Remover of Doublets (Scrublet), a framework for predicting the impact of multiplets in a given analysis and identifying problematic multiplets. Scrublet avoids the need for expert knowledge or cell clustering by simulating multiplets from the data and building a nearest neighbor classifier.

abstract = {Quantifying cell-type proportions and their corresponding gene expression profiles in tissue samples would enhance understanding of the contributions of individual cell types to the physiological states of the tissue. Current approaches that address tissue heterogeneity have drawbacks. Experimental techniques, such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and single cell RNA sequencing are expensive. Computational approaches that use expression data from heterogeneous samples are promising, but most of the current methods estimate either cell-type proportions or cell-type-specific expression profiles by requiring the other as input. Although such partial deconvolution methods have been successfully applied to tumor samples, the additional input required may be unavailable. We introduce a novel complete deconvolution method, CDSeq, that uses only RNA-Seq data from bulk tissue samples to simultaneously estimate both cell-type proportions and cell-type-specific expression profiles. Using several synthetic and real experimental datasets with known cell-type composition and cell-type-specific expression profiles, we compared CDSeq's complete deconvolution performance with seven other established deconvolution methods. Complete deconvolution using CDSeq represents a substantial technical advance over partial deconvolution approaches and will be useful for studying cell mixtures in tissue samples. CDSeq is available at GitHub repository (MATLAB and Octave code): https://github.com/kkang7/ CDSeq.},

Telomere length may represent one important mechanism by which dietary intake influences risk of age-related diseases; however, it is unknown which diet pattern is most strongly related to telomere length. We compared the relationships between 4 evidence-based diet quality indices and leukocyte telomere length in a nationally representative sample of healthy adults, and the extent to which these associations differed between men and women. Data on 4,758 adults aged 20-65 years with no prior diagnosis of major chronic disease were obtained from the 1999-2002 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Diet was assessed using one 24-hour dietary recall. After adjustment for sociodemographic and health characteristics, comparison of the top and bottom quintiles showed that higher Healthy Eating Index 2010 scores ($\beta$ = 0.065, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.018, 0.112; P-trend = 0.007), Alternate Healthy Eating Index 2010 scores ($\beta$ = 0.054, 95{\%} CI: 0.010, 0.097; P-trend = 0.007), Mediterranean Diet scores ($\beta$ = 0.058, 95{\%} CI: 0.017, 0.098; P-trend = 0.008), and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores ($\beta$ = 0.052, 95{\%} CI: 0.014, 0.090; P-trend = 0.007) were each associated with longer telomere length in women.

abstract = {The domestication of the Eurasian grape (Vitis vinifera ssp. sativa) from its wild ancestor (Vitis vinifera ssp. sylvestris) has long been claimed to have occurred in Transcaucasia where its greatest genetic diversity is found and where very early archaeological evidence, including grape pips and artefacts of a 'wine culture', have been excavated. Whether from Transcaucasia or the nearby Taurus or Zagros Mountains, it is hypothesized that this wine culture spread southwards and eventually westwards around the Mediterranean basin, together with the transplantation of cultivated grape cuttings. However, the existence of morphological differentiation between cultivars from eastern and western ends of the modern distribution of the Eurasian grape suggests the existence of different genetic contribution from local sylvestris populations or multilocal selection and domestication of sylvestris genotypes. To tackle this issue, we analysed chlorotype variation and distribution in 1201 samples of sylvestris and sativa genotypes from the whole area of the species' distribution and studied their genetic relationships. The results suggest the existence of at least two important origins for the cultivated germplasm, one in the Near East and another in the western Mediterranean region, the latter of which gave rise to many of the current Western European cultivars. Indeed, over 70{\%} of the Iberian Peninsula cultivars display chlorotypes that are only compatible with their having derived from western sylvestris populations. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors.},

abstract = {Objectives Highly effective vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been developed but variants of concerns (VOCs) with mutations in the spike protein are worrisome, especially B.1.617.2 (Delta) which has rapidly spread across the world. We aim to study if vaccination alters virological and serological kinetics in breakthrough infections.

Methods We conducted a multi-centre retrospective cohort study of patients in Singapore who had received a licensed mRNA vaccine and been admitted to hospital with B.1.617.2 SARS-CoV-2 infection. We compared the clinical features, virological and serological kinetics (anti-nucleocapsid, anti-spike and surrogate virus neutralization titres) between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.

Results Of 218 individuals with B.1.617.2 infection, 84 had received a mRNA vaccine of which 71 were fully vaccinated, 130 were unvaccinated and 4 received a non-mRNA. Despite significantly older age in the vaccine breakthrough group, the odds of severe COVID-19 requiring oxygen supplementation was significantly lower following vaccination (adjusted odds ratio 0.07 95{\%}CI: 0.015-0.335, p=0.001). PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values were similar between both vaccinated and unvaccinated groups at diagnosis, but viral loads decreased faster in vaccinated individuals. Early, robust boosting of anti-spike protein antibodies was observed in vaccinated patients, however, these titers were significantly lower against B.1.617.2 as compared with the wildtype vaccine strain.

Conclusion The mRNA vaccines are highly effective at preventing symptomatic and severe COVID-19 associated with B.1.617.2 infection. Vaccination is associated with faster decline in viral RNA load and a robust serological response. Vaccination remains a key strategy for control of COVID-19 pandemic.

abstract = {Purpose: For primary melanomas, tumor thickness, mitotic rate, and ulceration are well-laid corner-stones of prognostication. However, a molecular exposition of melanoma aggressiveness is critically missing. We recently uncovered a four-class structure in metastatic melanoma, which predicts outcome and informs biology. This raises the possibility that a molecular structure exists even in the early stages of melanoma and that molecular determinants could underlie histophenotype and eventual patient outcome. Experimental Design: We subjected 223 archival primary melanomas to a horizontally integrated analysis of RNA expression, oncogenic mutations at 238 lesions, histomorphometry, and survival data. Results: Our previously described four-class structure that was elucidated in metastatic lesions was evident within the expression space of primary melanomas. Because these subclasses converged into two larger prognostic and phenotypic groups, we used the metastatic lesions to develop a binary subtype-based signature capable of distinguishing between "high" and "low" grade forms of the disease. The two-grade signature was subsequently applied to the primary melanomas. Compared with low-grade tumors, high-grade primary melanomas were significantly associated with increased tumor thickness, mitotic rate, ulceration (all P {\textless} 0.01), and poorer relapse-free (HR = 4.94; 95{\%} CI, 2.84-8.59), and overall (HR = 3.66; 95{\%} CI, 2.40-5.58) survival. High-grade melanomas exhibited elevated levels of proliferation and BRCA1/DNA damage signaling genes, whereas low-grade lesions harbored higher expression of immune genes. Importantly, the molecular-grade signature was validated in two external gene expression data sets. Conclusions: We provide evidence for a molecular organization within melanomas, which is preserved across all stages of disease. {\textcopyright}2012 American Association for Cancer Research.},

abstract = {Although a similar prevalence of smoking is evident among patients with asthma and the general population, little is known about the impact of cigarette smoke on the immune inflammatory processes elicited by common environmental allergens. We investigated the impact of exposure to cigarette smoke on house dust mite (HDM)-induced allergic airway inflammation and its consequences for tissue remodeling and lung physiology in mice. BALB/c mice received intranasal HDMs daily, 5 days per week, for 3 weeks to establish chronic airway inflammation. Subsequently, mice were concurrently exposed to HDMs plus cigarette smoke, 5 days per week, for 2 weeks (HDMs + smoke). We observed significantly attenuated eosinophilia in the bronchoalveolar lavage of mice exposed to HDMs + smoke, compared with animals exposed only to HDMs. A similar activation of CD4 T cells and expression of IL-5, IL-13, and transforming growth factor-$\beta$ was observed between HDM-treated and HDM + smoke-treated animals. Consistent with an effect on eosinophil trafficking, HDMs + smoke exposure attenuated the HDM-induced expression of eotaxin-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, whereas the survival of eosinophils and the numbers of blood eosinophils were not affected. Exposure to cigarette smoke also reduced the activation of Bcells and the concentrations of serum IgE. Although the production of mucus decreased, collagen deposition significantly increased in animals exposed to HDMs 1 smoke, compared with animals exposed only to HDMs. Although airway resistance was unaffected, tissue resistance was significantly decreased in mice exposed to HDMs + smoke. Our findings demonstrate that cigarette smoke affects eosinophil migration without affecting airway resistance or modifying Th2 cell adaptive immunity in a murine model of HDM-induced asthma.},

The method is able to withstand high levels of noise and is capable of approximating data point clouds via principal graph ensembles. This strategy can be used to estimate the statisti al significance of complex data features and to summarize them into a single consensus principal graph. ElPiGraph deals efficiently with large datasets in various fields such as biology, where it can be used for example with single-cell transcriptomic or epigenomic datasets to infer gene expression dynamics and recover differentiation landscapes.},

abstract = {Grapevine is a very important crop species that is mainly cultivated worldwide for fruits, wine and juice. Identification of the genetic bases of performance traits through association mapping studies requires a precise knowledge of the available diversity and how this diversity is structured and varies across the whole genome. An 18k SNP genotyping array was evaluated on a panel of Vitis vinifera cultivars and we obtained a data set with no missing values for a total of 10207 SNPs and 783 different genotypes. The average inter-SNP spacing was ∼47 kbp, the mean minor allele frequency (MAF) was 0.23 and the genetic diversity in the sample was high (He = 0.32). Fourteen SNPs, chosen from those with the highest MAF values, were sufficient to identify each genotype in the sample. Parentage analysis revealed 118 full parentages and 490 parent-offspring duos, thus confirming the close pedigree relationships within the cultivated grapevine. Structure analyses also confirmed the main divisions due to an eastern-western gradient and human usage (table vs. wine). Using a multivariate approach, we refined the structure and identified a total of eight clusters. Both the genetic diversity (He, 0.26-0.32) and linkage disequilibrium (LD, 28.8-58.2 kbp) varied between clusters. Despite the short span LD, we also identified some non-recombining haplotype blocks that may complicate association mapping. Finally, we performed a genomewide association study that confirmed previous works and also identified new regions for important performance traits such as acidity. Taken together, all the results contribute to a better knowledge of the genetics of the cultivated grapevine.},

abstract = {Background: Adaptation to ER stress has been indicated to play an important role in resistance to therapy in human melanoma. However, the relationship between adaptation to ER stress and cell metastasis in human melanoma remains unclear. Methods: The relationship of adaptation to ER stress and cell metastasis was investigated using transwell and mouse metastasis assays. The potential molecular mechanism of KLF4 in regulating the adaptation to ER stress and cell metastasis was investigated using RNA sequencing analysis, q-RT-PCR and western blot assays. The transcriptional regulation of nucleobindin 2 (NUCB2) by KLF4 was identified using bioinformatic analysis, luciferase assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). The clinical significance of KLF4 and NUCB2 was based on human tissue microarray (TMA) analysis. Results: Here, we demonstrated that KLF4 was induced by ER stress in melanoma cells, and increased KLF4 inhibited cell apoptosis and promoted cell metastasis. Further mechanistic studies revealed that KLF4 directly bound to the promoter of NUCB2, facilitating its transcription. Additionally, an increase in KLF4 promoted melanoma ER stress resistance, tumour growth and cell metastasis by regulating NCUB2 expression in vitro and in vivo. Elevated KLF4 was found in human melanoma tissues, which was associated with NUCB2 expression. Conclusion: Our data revealed that the promotion of ER stress resistance via the KLF4-NUCB2 axis is essential for melanoma cell metastasis, and KLF4 may be a promising specific target for melanoma therapy.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive value of peripheral eosinophil and monocyte blood counts regarding lung function in smokers and non-smokers, and to investigate the influence of smoking on these cell counts. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) measurements and blood samples were collected from 298 non-atopic smokers and 136 never-smokers. Blood samples were repeated in 160 smokers after cessation of smoking (quitters) and 30 continuing smokers, 2, 6, 12 and 26 weeks after smoking cessation. Monocyte (P {\textless} 0.05) but not eosinophil blood counts were higher in never-smokers compared to smokers. In never-smokers, blood eosinophil counts and monocyte counts correlated inversely (P {\textless} 0.05) and directly (P {\textless} 0.01), respectively, with standardized FEV1 residuals (FEVR). In smokers, blood eosinophil (P {\textless} 0.05) and monocyte (P {\textless} 0.05) counts correlated directly with FEVR independent of smoking history. After smoking cessation, monocyte blood counts (P {\textless} 0.05) increased. Both eosinophil and monocyte blood counts showed a greater increase in quitters with decreased lung function (P {\textless} 0.05). Former heavy smokers had higher blood eosinophil (P {\textless} 0.05) but lower monocyte (P {\textless} 0.05) count increase than had former light smokers. These data suggest that smoking influences eosinophil and monocyte blood counts and that this is associated with a small negative effect on lung function. Eosinophil blood counts had an opposite relation to lung function in smokers and non-smokers. Further research should include investigations of relations between smoking and stimulatory factors for recruitment and activity of eosinophils and monocytes.},

This study aims to summarize basic reproduction number (R0) data and provide clues for designing prevention and control measures. METHODS: Several databases and preprint platforms were retrieved for literature reporting R0 values of COVID-19. The analysis was stratified by the prespecified modeling method to make the R0 values comparable, and by country/region to explore whether R0 estimates differed across the world. The average R0 values were pooled using a random-effects model. RESULTS: We identified 185 unique articles, yielding 43 articles for analysis. The selected studies covered 5 countries from Asia, 5 countries from Europe, 12 countries from Africa, and 1 from North America, South America, and Australia each. Exponential growth rate model was most favored by researchers. The pooled global R0 was 4.08 (95{\%} CI, 3.09-5.39). The R0 estimates for new and shifting epicenters were comparable or even higher than that for the original epicenter Wuhan, China. CONCLUSIONS: The high R0 values suggest that an extraordinary combination of control measures is needed for halting COVID-19.},

abstract = {Cellular plasticity of cancer cells is often associated with phenotypic heterogeneity and drug resistance and thus remains a major challenge for the treatment of melanoma and other types of cancer. Melanoma cells have the capacity to switch their phenotype during tumor progression, from a proliferative and differentiated phenotype to a more invasive and dedifferentiated phenotype. However, the molecular mechanisms driving this phenotype switch are not yet fully understood. Considering that cellular heterogeneity within the tumor contributes to the high plasticity typically observed in melanoma, it is crucial to generate suitable models to investigate this phenomenon in detail. Here, we discuss the use of complete and partial reprogramming into induced pluripotent cancer (iPC) cells as a tool to obtain new insights into melanoma cellular plasticity. We consider this a relevant topic due to the high plasticity of melanoma cells and its association with a strong resistance to standard anticancer treatments.},

The analysis of their texture provides so-called spot-clusters of co-expressed genes which require subsequent significance filtering and functional interpretation. We address feature selection in terms of the gene ranking problem and the interpretation of the obtained spot-related lists using concepts of molecular function.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Different expression scores based either on simple fold change-measures or on regularized Student's t-statistics are applied to spot-related gene lists and compared with special emphasis on the error characteristics of microarray expression data. The spot-clusters are analyzed using different methods of gene set enrichment analysis with the focus on overexpression and/or overrepresentation of predefined sets of genes. Metagene-related overrepresentation of selected gene sets was mapped into the SOM images to assign gene function to different regions. Alternatively we estimated set-related overexpression profiles over all samples studied using a gene set enrichment score. It was also applied to the spot-clusters to generate lists of enriched gene sets. We used the tissue body index data set, a collection of expression data of human tissues as an illustrative example. We found that tissue related spots typically contain enriched populations of gene sets well corresponding to molecular processes in the respective tissues. In addition, we display special sets of housekeeping and of consistently weak and high expressed genes using SOM data filtering.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The presented methods allow the comprehensive downstream analysis of SOM-transformed expression data in terms of cluster-related gene lists and enriched gene sets for functional interpretation. SOM clustering implies the ability to define either new gene sets using selected SOM spots or to verify and/or to amend existing ones.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered numerous genetic variants (SNPs) that are associated with blood pressure (BP). Genetic variants may lead to BP changes by acting on intermediate molecular phenotypes such as coded protein sequence or gene expression, which in turn affect BP variability. Therefore, characterizing genes whose expression is associated with BP may reveal cellular processes involved in BP regulation and uncover how transcripts mediate genetic and environmental effects on BP variability. A meta-analysis of results from six studies of global gene expression profiles of BP and hypertension in whole blood was performed in 7017 individuals who were not receiving antihypertensive drug treatment. We identified 34 genes that were differentially expressed in relation to BP (Bonferroni-corrected p{\textless}0.05). Among these genes, FOS and PTGS2 have been previously reported to be involved in BP-related processes; the others are novel. The top BP signature genes in aggregate explain 5{\%}–9{\%} of inter-individual variance in BP. Of note, rs3184504 in SH2B3, which was also reported in GWAS to be associated with BP, was found to be a trans regulator of the expression of 6 of the transcripts we found to be associated with BP (FOS, MYADM, PP1R15A, TAGAP, S100A10, and FGBP2). Gene set enrichment analysis suggested that the BP-related global gene expression changes include genes involved in inflammatory response and apoptosis pathways. Our study provides new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying BP regulation, and suggests novel transcriptomic markers for the treatment and prevention of hypertension.},

Tumour heterogeneity involves both genetic and epigenetic changes. Intrapatient heterogeneity is responsible for generating subpopulations of cancer cells which undergo clonal evolution with time. Tumour heterogeneity develops also as a consequence of the selective pressure imposed by the immune system. It has been demonstrated that tumour heterogeneity and different spatiotemporal interactions between all the cellular compontents within the tumour microenvironment lead to cancer adaptation and to therapeutic pressure. In this context, the recent advent of single cell analysis approaches which are able to better study tumour heterogeneity from the genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic standpoint represent a major technological breakthrough. In this review, using metastatic melanoma as a prototypical example, we will focus on applying single cell analyses to the study of clonal trajectories which guide the evolution of drug resistance to targeted therapy.},

Metabolic flux analysis (MFA), flux balance analysis (FBA), and metabolic pathway analysis (MPA) are among the most popular tools in stoichiometric network analysis. Although application of these tools into well-known microbial systems is extensive in the literature, various barriers prevent them from being utilized in mammalian cells. Limited experimental data, complex regulatory mechanisms, and the requirement of more complex nutrient media are some major obstacles in mammalian cell systems. However, mammalian cells have been used to produce therapeutic proteins, to characterize disease states or related abnormal metabolic conditions, and to analyze the toxicological effects of some medicinally important drugs. Therefore, there is a growing need for extending metabolic engineering principles to mammalian cells in order to understand their underlying metabolic functions. In this review article, advanced metabolic engineering tools developed for stoichiometric analysis including MFA, FBA, and MPA are described. Applications of these tools in mammalian cells are discussed in detail, and the challenges and opportunities are highlighted. {\textcopyright} 2011 Begell House, Inc.},

Mapping changes in gene expression at the module level generated disease-specific transcriptional fingerprints that provide a stable framework for the visualization and functional interpretation of microarray data. These transcriptional modules were used as a basis for the selection of biomarkers and the development of??a multivariate transcriptional indicator of disease progression in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Thus, this work describes the implementation and application of a methodology designed to support systems-scale analysis of the human immune system in translational research settings. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {High-throughput characterisation of the molecular response of pulpal tissue under carious lesions may contribute to improved future diagnosis and treatment. To identify genes associated with this process, oligonucleotide microarrays containing ∼15,000 human sequences were screened using pooled total RNA isolated from pulpal tissue from both healthy and carious teeth. Data analysis identified 445 genes with 2-fold or greater difference in expression level, with 85 more abundant in health and 360 more abundant in disease. Subsequent gene ontological grouping identified a variety of processes and functions potentially activated or down-modulated during caries. Validation of microarray results was obtained by a combination of real-time and semi-quantitative PCR for selected genes, confirming down-regulation of Dentin Matrix Protein-1 (DMP-1), SLIT2, Period-2 (PER2), Period-3 (PER3), osteoadherin, Glypican-3, Midkine, activin receptor interacting protein-1 (AIP1), osteoadherin and growth hormone receptor (GHR), and up-regulation of Adrenomedullin (ADM), Interleukin-11 (IL-11), Bone sialoprotein (BSP), matrix Gla protein (MGP), endothelial cell growth factor-1 (ECGF1), inhibin $\beta$A and orosomucoid-1 (ORM1), in diseased pulp. Real-time PCR analyses of ADM and DMP-1 in a panel of healthy and carious pulpal tissue and also in immune system cells highlighted the heterogeneity of caries and indicated increased expression of ADM in neutrophils activated by bacterial products. In contrast, DMP-1 was predominantly expressed by cells native to healthy pulpal tissue. This study has greatly extended our molecular knowledge of dental tissue disease and identified involvement of genes previously unassociated with this process. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Telomeres serve to camouflage chromosome ends from the DNA damage response machinery. Telomerase activity is required to maintain telomeres. One consequence of telomere dysfunction is cellular senescence, a permanent growth arrest state. We review the key regulators of cellular senescence and recent in vivo evidence which supports p53-dependent senescence induced by short telomeres as a potent tumor suppressor pathway. The in vivo link between cellular senescence and tumor regression is also discussed. The relationship between short telomere length and ageing or disease states in various cells of the body is increasingly reported. Paradoxically, the introduction of telomerase is proposed as a method to combat ageing via cell therapy and a possible method to regenerate tissue, while telomerase inhibition and telomere shortening is suggested as a possible therapy to defeat cancers with intact p53. Researchers thus face the challenge of understanding the complex processes which regulate the potential benefits of both telomerase inhibition and activation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Coeliac disease (CD) is a clinically heterogeneous autoimmune disease with variable presentation and progression triggered by gluten intake. Molecular or genetic factors contribute to disease heterogeneity, but the reasons for different outcomes are poorly understood. Transcriptome studies of tissue biopsies from CD patients are scarce. Here, we present a high-resolution analysis of the transcriptomes extracted from duodenal biopsies of 24 children and adolescents with active CD and 21 individuals without CD but with intestinal afflictions as controls. The transcriptomes of CD patients divide into three groups—a mixed group presenting the control cases, and CD-low and CD-high groups referring to lower and higher levels of CD severity. Persistence of symptoms was weakly associated with subgroup, but the highest marsh stages were present in subgroup CD-high, together with the highest cell cycle rates as an indicator of virtually complete villous atrophy. Considerable variation in inflammation-level between subgroups was further deciphered into immune cell types using cell type de-convolution. Self-organizing maps portrayal was applied to provide high-resolution landscapes of the CD-transcriptome. We find asymmetric patterns of miRNA and long non-coding RNA and discuss the effect of epigenetic regulation. Expression of genes involved in interferon gamma signaling represent suitable markers to distinguish CD from non-CD cases. Multiple pathways overlay in CD biopsies in different ways, giving rise to heterogeneous transcriptional patterns, which potentially provide information about etiology and the course of the disease.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here we defined a normal range of gene expression over 6 months in the blood of four cohorts of healthy men and women who were stratified by age (22–55 years and {\textgreater} 55 years) and gender. Eleven immunomodulatory genes likely to play important roles in inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and infection in addition to four genes typically used as reference genes were examined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), as well as the full genome as represented by Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. Gene expression levels as assessed by qRT-PCR and microarray were relatively stable over time with {\~{}}2{\%} of genes as measured by microarray showing intra-subject differences over time periods longer than one month. Fifteen genes varied by gender. The eleven genes examined by qRT-PCR remained within a limited dynamic range for all individuals. Specifically, for the seven most stably expressed genes (CXCL1, HMOX1, IL1RN, IL1B, IL6R, PTGS2, and TNF), 95{\%} of all samples profiled fell within 1.5–2.5 Ct, the equivalent of a 4- to 6-fold dynamic range. Two subjects who experienced severe adverse events of cancer and anemia, had microarray gene expression profiles that were distinct from normal while subjects who experienced an infection had only slightly elevated levels of inflammatory markers. This study defines the range and variability of gene expression in healthy men and women over a six-month period. These parameters can be used to estimate the number of subjects needed to observe significant differences from normal gene expression in clinical studies. A set of genes that varied by gender was also identified as were a set of genes with elevated expression in a subject with iron deficiency anemia and another subject being treated for lung cancer.},

abstract = {Blood-based biomarker assays have an advantage in being minimally invasive. Diagnostic and prognostic models built on peripheral blood gene expression have been reported for various types of disease. However, most of these studies focused on only one disease type, and failed to address whether the identified gene expression signature is disease-specific or more widely applicable across diseases. We conducted a meta-analysis of 46 whole blood gene expression datasets covering a wide range of diseases and physiological conditions. Our analysis uncovered a striking overlap of signature genes shared by multiple diseases, driven by an underlying common pattern of cell component change, specifically an increase in myeloid cells and decrease in lymphocytes. These observations reveal the necessity of building disease-specific classifiers that can distinguish different disease types as well as normal controls, and highlight the importance of cell component change in deriving blood gene expression based models. We developed a new strategy to develop blood-based disease-specific models by leveraging both cell component changes and cell molecular state changes, and demonstrate its superiority using independent datasets.},

URD identified the trajectories of 25 cell types through early somitogenesis, gene expression along them, and their spatial origin in the blastula. Analysis of Nodal signaling mutants revealed that their transcriptomes were canalized into a subset of wild-type transcriptional trajectories. Some wild-type developmental branch points contained cells that express genes characteristic of multiple fates. These cells appeared to trans-specify from one fate to another. These findings reconstruct the transcriptional trajectories of a vertebrate embryo, highlight the concurrent canalization and plasticity of embryonic specification, and provide a framework with which to reconstruct complex developmental trees from single-cell transcriptomes.},

abstract = {Background: The mountainous region between the Caucasus and China is considered to be the center of domestication for grapevine. Despite the importance of Central Asia in the history of grape growing, information about the extent and distribution of grape genetic variation in this region is limited in comparison to wild and cultivated grapevines from around the Mediterranean basin. The principal goal of this work was to survey the genetic diversity and relationships among wild and cultivated grape germplasm from the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Mediterranean basin collectively to understand gene flow, possible domestication events and adaptive introgression. Results: A total of 1378 wild and cultivated grapevines collected around the Mediterranean basin and from Central Asia were tested with a set of 20 nuclear SSR markers. Genetic data were analyzed (Cluster analysis, Principal Coordinate Analysis and STRUCTURE) to identify groups, and the results were validated by Nei's genetic distance, pairwise FST analysis and assignment tests. All of these analyses identified three genetic groups: G1, wild accessions from Croatia, France, Italy and Spain; G2, wild accessions from Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia; and G3, cultivars from Spain, France, Italy, Georgia, Iran, Pakistan and Turkmenistan, which included a small group of wild accessions from Georgia and Croatia. Wild accessions from Georgia clustered with cultivated grape from the same area (proles pontica), but also with Western Europe (proles occidentalis), supporting Georgia as the ancient center of grapevine domestication. In addition, cluster analysis indicated that Western European wild grapes grouped with cultivated grapes from the same area, suggesting that the cultivated proles occidentalis contributed more to the early development of wine grapes than the wild vines from Eastern Europe. Conclusions: The analysis of genetic relationships among the tested genotypes provided evidence of genetic relationships between wild and cultivated accessions in the Mediterranean basin and Central Asia. The genetic structure indicated a considerable amount of gene flow, which limited the differentiation between the two subspecies. The results also indicated that grapes with mixed ancestry occur in the regions where wild grapevines were domesticated.},

They split into astrocytoma-(IDH-A) and oligodendroglioma-like (IDH-O) tumors both carrying mutations(s) at the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene and into IDH wild type (IDH-wt) gliomas of glioblastoma resemblance. We generated detailed maps of the transcriptomes and DNA methylomes, revealing that cell functions divided into three major archetypic hallmarks: (i) increased proliferation in IDH-wt and, to a lesser degree, IDH-O; (ii) increased inflammation in IDH-A and IDH-wt; and (iii) the loss of synaptic transmis-sion in all subtypes. Immunogenic properties of IDH-A are diverse, partly resembling signatures observed in grade IV mesenchymal glioblastomas or in grade I pilocytic astrocytomas. We analyzed details of coregulation between gene expression and DNA methylation and of the immunogenic micro-environment presumably driving tumor development and treatment resistance. Our transcrip-tome and methylome maps support personalized, case-by-case views to decipher the heterogeneity of glioma states in terms of data portraits. Thereby, molecular cartography provides a graphical coordinate system that links gene-level information with glioma subtypes, their phenotypes, and clinical context.},

abstract = {Background: It is not yet known whether DNA methylation levels can be used to accurately predict age across a broad spectrum of human tissues and cell types, nor whether the resulting age prediction is a biologically meaningful measure.Results: I developed a multi-tissue predictor of age that allows one to estimate the DNA methylation age of most tissues and cell types. The predictor, which is freely available, was developed using 8,000 samples from 82 Illumina DNA methylation array datasets, encompassing 51 healthy tissues and cell types. I found that DNA methylation age has the following properties: first, it is close to zero for embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells; second, it correlates with cell passage number; third, it gives rise to a highly heritable measure of age acceleration; and, fourth, it is applicable to chimpanzee tissues. Analysis of 6,000 cancer samples from 32 datasets showed that all of the considered 20 cancer types exhibit significant age acceleration, with an average of 36 years. Low age-acceleration of cancer tissue is associated with a high number of somatic mutations and TP53 mutations, while mutations in steroid receptors greatly accelerate DNA methylation age in breast cancer. Finally, I characterize the 353 CpG sites that together form an aging clock in terms of chromatin states and tissue variance.Conclusions: I propose that DNA methylation age measures the cumulative effect of an epigenetic maintenance system. This novel epigenetic clock can be used to address a host of questions in developmental biology, cancer and aging research. {\textcopyright} 2013 Horvath; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {The immune system plays a key role in health maintenance and pathogenesis of a wide range of diseases. Leukocytes that are present in the blood convey valuable information about the status of the immune system. Blood transcriptomics, which consists in profiling blood transcript abundance on genome-wide scales, has gained in popularity over the past several years. Indeed, practicality and simplicity largely makes up for what this approach may lack in terms of cell population-level resolution. An extensive survey of the literature reveals increasingly widespread use across virtually all fields of medicine as well as across a number of different animal species, including model organisms but also animals of economical importance. Dissemination across such a wide range of disciplines holds the promise of adding a new perspective, breadth or context, to the considerable depth afforded by whole genome profiling of blood transcript abundance. Indeed, it is only through such contextualization that a truly global perspective will be gained from the use of systems approaches. Also discussed are opportunities that may arise for the fields of immunology and medicine from using blood transcriptomics as a common denominator for developing interactions and cooperation across fields of research that have traditionally been and largely remain compartmentalized. Finally, an argument is made for building immunology research capacity using blood transcriptomics platforms in low-resource and high-disease burden settings.},

abstract = {During wound healing in adult mouse skin, hair follicles and then adipocytes regenerate. Adipocytes regenerate from myofibroblasts, a specialized contractile wound fibroblast. Here we study wound fibroblast diversity using single-cell RNA-sequencing. On analysis, wound fibroblasts group into twelve clusters. Pseudotime and RNA velocity analyses reveal that some clusters likely represent consecutive differentiation states toward a contractile phenotype, while others appear to represent distinct fibroblast lineages. One subset of fibroblasts expresses hematopoietic markers, suggesting their myeloid origin. We validate this finding using single-cell western blot and single-cell RNA-sequencing on genetically labeled myofibroblasts. Using bone marrow transplantation and Cre recombinase-based lineage tracing experiments, we rule out cell fusion events and confirm that hematopoietic lineage cells give rise to a subset of myofibroblasts and rare regenerated adipocytes. In conclusion, our study reveals that wounding induces a high degree of heterogeneity among fibroblasts and recruits highly plastic myeloid cells that contribute to adipocyte regeneration.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND SARS-CoV-2 Variants concerning for enhanced transmission, evasion of immune responses, or associated with severe disease have motivated the global increase in genomic surveillance. In this study, large scale whole genome sequencing was performed between November 2020 and end of March 2021 to provide a phylodynamic analysis of circulating variants over-time. In addition, we compared the viral genomic features of March 2020 and March 2021. METHODS A total of 1,600 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes were analyzed. Genomic analysis was associated with laboratory diagnostic volumes and positivity rates in addition to an analysis of the association of selected variants of concern/ interest with disease severity and outcomes. Our real-time surveillance features a cohort of specimens from patients who tested positive after the completion of vaccination. RESULTS Our data showed genomic diversity over-time that was not limited to the Spike sequence. A significant increase in the B.1.1.7 lineage (alpha variant) in March 2021 as well as a transient circulation of regional variants that carried both the concerning S: E484K and S: P681H substitutions were noted. Lineage B.1.243 was significantly associated with ICU admission and mortality. Genomes recovered from fully-vaccinated individuals represented the predominant lineages circulating at specimen collection time, and those infections recovered with no hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS Our results emphasize the importance of genomic surveillance coupled with laboratory, clinical, and metadata analysis for a better understanding of the dynamics of viral spread and evolution.},

abstract = {The use of quantitative gene expression analysis for the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of disease requires the ability to distinguish pathophysiological changes from natural variations. To characterize these variations in apparently healthy subjects, quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure various immune response genes in whole blood collected from blood bank donors. In a single-time-point study of 131 donors, of 48 target genes, 43 were consistently expressed and 34 followed approximately log-normal distribution. Most transcripts showed a limited dynamic range of expression across subjects. Specifically, 36 genes had standard deviations (SDs) of 0.44 to 0.79 cycle threshold (C(T)) units, corresponding to less than a 3-fold variation in expression. Separately, a longitudinal study of 8 healthy individuals demonstrated a total dynamic range ({\textgreater} 2 standard error units) of 2- to 4-fold in most genes. In contrast, a study of whole blood gene expression in 6 volunteers injected with LPS showed 15 genes changing in expression 10- to 90-fold within 2 to 5 h and returning to within normal range within 21 hours. This work demonstrates that () the dynamic range of expression of many immune response genes is limited among healthy subjects; () expression levels for most genes analyzed are approximately log-normally distributed; and () individuals exposed to an infusion of bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), show gene expression profiles that can be readily distinguished from those of a healthy population. These results suggest that normal reference ranges can be established for gene expression assays, providing critical standards for the diagnosis and management of disease.},

abstract = {The stromal compartment of the tumor microenvironment consists of a heterogeneous set of tissue-resident and tumor-infiltrating cells, which are profoundly moulded by cancer cells. An outstanding question is to what extent this heterogeneity is similar between cancers affecting different organs. Here, we profile 233,591 single cells from patients with lung, colorectal, ovary and breast cancer (n = 36) and construct a pan-cancer blueprint of stromal cell heterogeneity using different single-cell RNA and protein-based technologies. We identify 68 stromal cell populations, of which 46 are shared between cancer types and 22 are unique. We also characterise each population phenotypically by highlighting its marker genes, transcription factors, metabolic activities and tissue-specific expression differences. Resident cell types are characterised by substantial tissue specificity, while tumor-infiltrating cell types are largely shared across cancer types. Finally, by applying the blueprint to melanoma tumors treated with checkpoint immunotherapy and identifying a na{\"{i}}ve CD4+ T-cell phenotype predictive of response to checkpoint immunotherapy, we illustrate how it can serve as a guide to interpret scRNA-seq data. In conclusion, by providing a comprehensive blueprint through an interactive web server, we generate the first panoramic view on the shared complexity of stromal cells in different cancers.},

We have previously reported that CS induces chromatin remodeling in pro-inflammatory gene promoters; however, the underlying site-specific histone marks formed in histones H3 and H4 during CS exposure in lungs in vivo and in lung cells in vitro, which can either drive gene expression or repression, are not known. We hypothesize that CS exposure in mouse and human bronchial epithelial cells (H292) can cause site-specific posttranslational histone modifications (PTMs) that may play an important role in the pathogenesis of CS-induced chronic lung diseases. We used a bottom-up mass spectrometry approach to identify some potentially novel histone marks, including acetylation, monomethylation, and dimethylation, in specific lysine and arginine residues of histones H3 and H4 in mouse lungs and H292 cells. We found that CS-induced distinct posttranslational histone modification patterns in histone H3 and histone H4 in lung cells, which may be considered as usable biomarkers for CS-induced chronic lung diseases. These identified histone marks (histone H3 and histone H4) may play an important role in the epigenetic state during the pathogenesis of smoking-induced chronic lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer.},

Improved glycemic control achieved by insulin, insulin secretagogues or thiazolidinedione therapy is generally accompanied by weight gain. It is a problematic side effect of therapy due to the known deleterious effect of weight gain on glucose control, increased blood pressure and worsening lipid profile. Weight gain may be lessened or prevented by adherence to diet and exercise or combination therapy with metformin. Weight gain is also common in psychotropic therapy. The atypical antipsychotic drugs (clozapine, olanzepine, risperidone and quetiapine) are known to cause marked weight gain. Antidepressants such as amitriptyline, mirtazapine and some serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) also may promote appreciable weight gain that cannot be explained solely by improvement in depressive symptoms. The same phenomenon is observed with mood stabilizers such as lithium, valproic acid and carbamazepine. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) that promote weight gain include valproate, carbamazepine and gabapentin. Lamotrigine is an AED that is weight-neutral, while topiramate and zonisamide may induce weight loss.},

abstract = {We assessed the ability of platelet sonicates and mediators secreted by unstimulated and thrombin-stimulated platelets to facilitate the release of iron from transferrin. Platelet sonicates and platelet conditioned media potentiated the release of iron from transferrin. The rate of release of iron was dependent on the pH of the reaction and amount of platelet sample added. Conditioned media from thrombin-stimulated platelets was more effective in mediating the release of iron from transferrin than was conditioned media from unstimulated cells. The rate of iron released from transferrin following addition of ATP and ADP in amounts equivalent to that present in platelet conditioned media was significantly less than the rate of iron released following the addition of conditioned media from platelets. Depletion of ATP and ADP in platelet conditioned media by incubation with apyrase only partially inhibited their ability to enhance the rate of iron release from transferrin. These observations indicate that platelets enhance the release of iron from transferrin by adenine nucleotide-dependent and -independent mechanisms. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that platelets promote oxidant-induced tissue injury at sights of inflammation secondary to their ability to enhance the local release of iron from transferrin. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

We aimed to investigate the impact of cigarette smoking on platelet function in patients with ischemic coronary heart disease (CHD).Methods: Twenty patients with ischemic stable CHD under aspirin therapy (300 mg/d), who continue to smoking despite all warnings, and 20 nonsmokers with CHD are enrolled in the study. Platelet function is studied at the morning, before and 15 minutes after the first cigarette, by the Platelet Function Analyzer (PFA)-100, with collagen and epinephrine and collagen and adenosine diphosphate cartridges. Post aspirin platelet hyperactivity is defined as having a closure time (CT) shorter than 186 seconds despite regular aspirin intake. Serial CT measurements are analyzed by paired samples t test.Results: Persistent platelet activity was present in 4 smoker (20{\%}) and 3 nonsmoker (15{\%}) patients at the beginning. Platelet activity measured by the PFA-100 is been increased significantly after cigarette smoking (P = .004). Shorter CTs were determined after smoking in all patients with and without baseline persistent platelet activity, and 4 more participants became aspirin nonresponder (P = .004). No significant differences in demographic, hematological, and biochemical parameters were determined between aspirin responders and nonresponders.Conclusions: We determined that cigarette smoking may increase platelet aggregation in patients with ischemic CHD in an aspirin nonresponsive manner.

Gene expression measurements from these independent datasets, generated using samples from fresh frozen surgical specimens and postmortem tissues, are consistent. Overall, the different genome-wide analyses support a distribution in which many proteins are found in all tissues and relatively few in a tissue-restricted manner.

To understand the impact of these variants, we evaluated the neutralization potency of 99 individuals that received one or two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines against pseudoviruses representing 10 globally circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. Five of the 10 pseudoviruses, harboring receptor-binding domain mutations, including K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y, were highly resistant to neutralization. Cross-neutralization of B.1.351 variants was comparable to SARS-CoV and bat-derived WIV1-CoV, suggesting that a relatively small number of mutations can mediate potent escape from vaccine responses. While the clinical impact of neutralization resistance remains uncertain, these results highlight the potential for variants to escape from neutralizing humoral immunity and emphasize the need to develop broadly protective interventions against the evolving pandemic.},

Here, we used a single-cell enrichment and RNA-sequencing pipeline to study human epidermal melanocytes directly from the skin, capturing transcriptomes across different anatomical sites, developmental age, sexes and multiple skin tones. We uncovered subpopulations of melanocytes that exhibit anatomical site-specific enrichment that occurs during gestation and persists through adulthood. The transcriptional signature of the volar-enriched subpopulation is retained in acral melanomas. Furthermore, we identified human melanocyte differentiation transcriptional programs that are distinct from gene signatures generated from model systems. Finally, we used these programs to define patterns of dedifferentiation that are predictive of melanoma prognosis and response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.},

abstract = {Chemical carcinogenesis induced by lifestyle factors like cigarette smoking is a major research area in molecular epidemiology. Gene expression analysis of large numbers of genes simultaneously using microarrays holds the opportunity to study the effects of such an exposure at the genome level yielding more mechanism-based information. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate multiple gene expressions in blood, indicative for the effects caused by cigarette smoke. Smoking-discordant monozygotic twin pairs (n=9) were studied to diminish influences of genetic background. Using a dedicated microarray containing 600 toxicologically relevant genes, we investigated which genes are differentially expressed in smokers compared to non-smokers. We also looked for genes of which the expression changes correlated with DNA adducts, a biomarker of effective dose for exposure to cigarette smoke carcinogens. The mean DNA adduct level in smokers differed significantly from that in non-smokers (mean +/- standard error 1.96 +/- 0.24 versus 1.17 +/- 0.16 adducts per 10(8) nucleotides, respectively; P=0.04). The genes of which the expression differed most significantly between smokers and non-smokers are ATF4, MAPK14, SOD2, CYP1B1 and SERPINB2. CYP1B1 and SOD2 can directly be linked to cigarette smoke exposure, whereas the other genes are associated with stress or environmentally induced response. Main functions of the genes influenced by cigarette smoking comprise carcinogen metabolism, oxidative stress response and anti-apoptosis.},

abstract = {Background: Obesity, defined as pathologically increased body mass index (BMI), is strongly related to an increased risk for numerous common cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. It is particularly associated with insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and systemic oxidative stress and represents the most important risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these associations are still not completely understood. Therefore, in order to identify potentially disease-relevant BMI-associated gene expression signatures, a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) on BMI was performed. Methods: Whole-blood mRNA levels determined by array-based transcriptional profiling were correlated with BMI in two large independent population-based cohort studies (KORA F4 and SHIP-TREND) comprising a total of 1977 individuals. Results: Extensive alterations of the whole-blood transcriptome were associated with BMI: More than 3500 transcripts exhibited significant positive or negative BMI-correlation. Three major whole-blood gene expression signatures associated with increased BMI were identified. The three signatures suggested: i) a ratio shift from mature erythrocytes towards reticulocytes, ii) decreased expression of several genes essentially involved in the transmission and amplification of the insulin signal, and iii) reduced expression of several key genes involved in the defence against reactive oxygen species (ROS). Conclusions: Whereas the first signature confirms published results, the other two provide possible mechanistic explanations for well-known epidemiological findings under conditions of increased BMI, namely attenuated insulin signaling and increased oxidative stress. The putatively causative BMI-dependent down-regulation of the expression of numerous genes on the mRNA level represents a novel finding. BMI-associated negative transcriptional regulation of insulin signaling and oxidative stress management provide new insights into the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome and T2D.},

It can be applied to stem cells and their descendants in order to chart the progression from multipotent progenitors to fully differentiated cells. While a variety of statistical and computational methods have been proposed for inferring cell lineages, the problem of accurately characterizing multiple branching lineages remains difficult to solve. Results: We introduce Slingshot, a novel method for inferring cell lineages and pseudotimes from single-cell gene expression data. In previously published datasets, Slingshot correctly identifies the biological signal for one to three branching trajectories. Additionally, our simulation study shows that Slingshot infers more accurate pseudotimes than other leading methods. Conclusions: Slingshot is a uniquely robust and flexible tool which combines the highly stable techniques necessary for noisy single-cell data with the ability to identify multiple trajectories. Accurate lineage inference is a critical step in the identification of dynamic temporal gene expression.},

abstract = {Most patients with BRAFV600 -mutant metastatic melanoma develop resistance to selective RAF kinase inhibitors. The spectrum of clinical genetic resistance mechanisms to RAF inhibitors and options for salvage therapy are incompletely understood. We performed whole-exome sequencing on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors from 45 patients with BRAF V600 -mutant metastatic melanoma who received vemurafenib or dabrafenib monotherapy. Genetic alterations in known or putative RAF inhibitor resistance genes were observed in 23 of 45 patients (51{\%}). Besides previously characterized alterations, we discovered a "long tail" of new mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway alterations (MAP2K2, MITF) that confer RAF inhibitor resistance. In three cases, multiple resistance gene alterations were observed within the same tumor biopsy. Overall, RAF inhibitor therapy leads to diverse clinical genetic resistance mechanisms, mostly involving MAPK pathway reactivation. Novel therapeutic combinations may be needed to achieve durable clinical control of BRAFV600 -mutant melanoma. Integrating clinical genomics with preclinical screens may model subsequent resistance studies. Significance: The use of RAF inhibitors for BRAF V600 -mutant metastatic melanoma improves patient outcomes, but most patients demonstrate early or acquired resistance to this targeted therapy. We reveal the genetic landscape of clinical resistance mechanisms to RAF inhibitors from patients using whole-exome sequencing, and experimentally assess new observed mechanisms to define potential subsequent treatment strategies. {\textcopyright} 2013 AACR.},

Of the currently known SARS-CoV-2 clades, clade GR was the most prevalent worldwide followed by GV then GH. Chronological analysis revealed expansion in SARS-CoV-2 clades carrying D614G mutations with the predominance of the newest clade, GV, in the last three months.

In contrast, G and GV clades showed a significantly higher prevalence among asymptomatic patients or those with mild disease. Metadata analysis showed higher (p {\textless} 0.05) prevalence of severe/deceased cases among males than females and predominance of GR clade in female patients. Furthermore, severe disease/death was more prevalent (p {\textless} 0.05) in elderly than in adults/children.

Here we perform PT analysis of 3 melanoma short-term cultures with different genetic backgrounds to study specific and concordant properties of PT dynamics of selected cellular programs with impact on melanoma progression. Overall, in our setting of melanoma cells PT dynamics towards higher tumor malignancy appears to be largely driven by cell cycle genes. Single cells of all three short-term cultures show a bipolar expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (AXL) signatures. Furthermore, opposing gene expression changes are observed for genes regulated by epigenetic mechanisms suggesting epigenetic reprogramming during melanoma progression. The three melanoma short-term cultures show common themes of PT dynamics such as a stromal signature at initiation, bipolar expression of the MITF/AXL signature and opposing regulation of poised and activated promoters. Differences are observed at the late stage of PT dynamics with high, low or intermediate MITF and anticorrelated AXL signatures. These findings may help to identify targets for interference at different stages of tumor progression.},

The simplicity of such functional representations can provide an improved performance on fundamental tasks such as noise reduction, imputation and differential expression analysis. However, temporal gene expression profiles are often studied with models that treat time as a categorical variable, neglecting the dependence between time points. Here, we present ImpulseDE2, a framework for differential expression analysis that combines the power of the impulse model as a continuous representation of temporal responses along with a noise model tailored specifically to sequencing data. We compare the simple categorical models to ImpulseDE2 and to other continuous models based on natural cubic splines and demonstrate the utility of the continuous approach for studying differential expression in time course sequencing experiments. A unique feature of ImpulseDE2 is the ability to distinguish permanently from transiently up- or down-regulated genes. Using an in vitro differentiation dataset, we demonstrate that this gene classification scheme can be used to highlight distinct transcriptional programs that are associated with different phases of the differentiation process.},

Planarians undergo whole-body regeneration and tissue turnover, providing a model for adult positional information studies. Genes encoding secreted and transmembrane components of multiple developmental pathways are predominantly expressed in planarian muscle cells. Several of these genes regulate regional identity, consistent with muscle harboring positional information. Here, single-cell RNA-sequencing of 115 muscle cells from distinct anterior-posterior regions identified 44 regionally expressed genes, including multiple Wnt and ndk/FGF receptor-like (ndl/ FGFRL) genes. Two distinct FGFRL-Wnt circuits, involving juxtaposed anterior FGFRL and posterior Wnt expression domains, controlled planarian head and trunk patterning. ndl-3 and wntP-2 inhibition expanded the trunk, forming ectopic mouths and secondary pharynges, which independently extended and ingested food. fz5/8-4 inhibition, like that of ndk and wntA, caused posterior brain expansion and ectopic eye formation. Our results suggest that FGFRL-Wnt circuits operate within a body-wide coordinate system to control adult axial positioning.},

abstract = {Melanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer and treatment of metastatic melanoma remains challenging. BRAF/MEK inhibitors show only temporary benefit due the occurrence of resistance and immunotherapy is effective only in a subset of patients. To improve patient survival, there is a need to better understand molecular mechanisms that drive melanoma growth and operate downstream of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. The Kr{\"{u}}ppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is a zinc-finger transcription factor that plays a critical role in embryonic development, stemness and cancer, where it can act either as oncogene or tumor suppressor. KLF4 is highly expressed in post-mitotic epidermal cells, but its role in melanoma remains unknown. Here, we address the function of KLF4 in melanoma and its interaction with the MAPK signaling pathway. We find that KLF4 is highly expressed in a subset of human melanomas. Ectopic expression of KLF4 enhances melanoma cell growth by decreasing apoptosis. Conversely, knock-down of KLF4 reduces melanoma cell proliferation and induces cell death. In addition, depletion of KLF4 reduces melanoma xenograft growth in vivo. We find that the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling positively modulates KLF4 expression through the transcription factor E2F1, which directly binds to KLF4 promoter. Overall, our data demonstrate the pro-tumorigenic role of KLF4 in melanoma and uncover a novel ERK1/2-E2F1-KLF4 axis. These findings identify KLF4 as a possible new molecular target for designing novel therapeutic treatments to control melanoma growth.},

Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identified six CAF subpopulations in 4T1 tumors including: 1) myofibroblastic CAFs, enriched for $\alpha$-smooth muscle actin and several other contractile proteins; 2) ‘inflammatory' CAFs with elevated expression of inflammatory cytokines; and 3) a CAF subpopulation expressing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II proteins that are generally expressed in antigen-presenting cells. Comparison of 4T1-derived CAFs to CAFs from pancreatic cancer revealed that these three CAF subpopulations exist in both tumor types. Interestingly, cells with inflammatory and MHC class II-expressing CAF profiles were also detected in normal breast/pancreas tissue, suggesting that these phenotypes are not tumor microenvironment-induced. This work enhances our understanding of CAF heterogeneity, and specifically targeting these CAF subpopulations could be an effective therapeutic approach for treating highly aggressive TNBCs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) and other T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases develop in individuals carrying a complex susceptibility trait, probably following exposure to various environmental triggers. Owing to the presumed weak influence of single genes on disease predisposition and the recognized genetic heterogeneity of autoimmune disorders in humans, candidate gene searches in MS have been difficult. In an attempt to identify molecular markers indicative of disease status rather than susceptibility genes for MS, we show that gene expression profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by cDNA microarrays can distinguish MS patients from healthy controls. Our findings support the concept that the activation of autoreactive T cells is of primary importance for this complex organ-specific disorder and prompt further investigations on gene expression in peripheral blood cells aimed at characterizing disease phenotypes.},

It is the first study of this kind and size in an urban population in the eastern part of Germany. The study is conducted by the Leipzig Research Centre for Civilization Diseases (LIFE). Our objective is to investigate prevalences, early onset markers, genetic predispositions, and the role of lifestyle factors of major civilization diseases, with primary focus on metabolic and vascular diseases, heart function, cognitive impairment, brain function, depression, sleep disorders and vigilance dysregulation, retinal and optic nerve degeneration, and allergies. Methods/design: The study covers a main age range from 40-79 years with particular deep phenotyping in elderly participants above the age of 60. The baseline examination was conducted from August 2011 to November 2014. All participants underwent an extensive core assessment programme (5-6 h) including structured interviews, questionnaires, physical examinations, and biospecimen collection. Participants over 60 underwent two additional assessment programmes (3-4 h each) on two separate visits including deeper cognitive testing, brain magnetic resonance imaging, diagnostic interviews for depression, and electroencephalography. Discussion: The participation rate was 33 {\%}. The assessment programme was accepted well and completely passed by almost all participants. Biomarker analyses have already been performed in all participants. Genotype, transcriptome and metabolome analyses have been conducted in subgroups. The first follow-up examination will commence in 2016.},

Design: Cross-sectional study of 452 men from the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study examining the resting concentration of white blood cell subfractions across fitness (maximal METs during a treadmill exercise test) and fatness (BMI) categories after adjusting for age. Results: Fitness was inversely associated with all WBC subfraction concentrations. After further adjustment for BMI, only total WBC, neutrophil, and basophil concentrations remained significantly associated with fitness. BMI was directly associated with total WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, and basophil concentrations and, when fitness was added to the model, only monocytes lost significance.

Since its creation, MSigDB has grown beyond its roots in metabolic disease and cancer to include {\textgreater}10,000 gene sets. These better represent a wider range of biological processes and diseases, but the utility of the database is reduced by increased redundancy across, and heterogeneity within, gene sets. To address this challenge, here we use a combination of automated approaches and expert curation to develop a collection of "hallmark" gene sets as part of MSigDB. Each hallmark in this collection consists of a "refined" gene set, derived from multiple "founder" sets, that conveys a specific biological state or process and displays coherent expression. The hallmarks effectively summarize most of the relevant information of the original founder sets and, by reducing both variation and redundancy, provide more refined and concise inputs for gene set enrichment analysis.},

This study characterizes the effects of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection on gene expression by analyzing blood samples from 10 treatment-na{\"{i}}ve HCV patients and 6 healthy volunteers. Differential expression analysis of microarray data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) identified a 136-gene signature, including 66 genes elevated in infected individuals. Most of the upregulated genes were associated with interferon (IFN) activity (including members of the OAS and MX families, ISG15, and IRF7), suggesting an ongoing immune response. This HCV signature was also found to be consistently enriched in many other viral infection and vaccination datasets. These genes were validated using a second cohort composed of 5 HCV patients and 5 healthy volunteers, confirming the upregulation of the IFN signature. In summary, this is the first study to directly compare blood transcriptional profiles from HCV patients with healthy controls. The results show that chronic HCV infection has a pronounced effect on gene expression in PBMCs of infected individuals, and significantly elevates the expression of a subset of IFN-stimulated genes.},

ORF7a is implicated in immune modulation, and we show that the C-terminal truncation negates anti-immune activities of the protein, which results in elevated type I interferon response to the viral infection.

Here we analyse 20 BRAF V600 -mutant melanoma metastases derived from 10 patients treated with the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib for resistance mechanisms and genetic correlates of response. Resistance mechanisms are identified in 9/11 progressing tumours and MAPK reactivation occurred in 9/10 tumours, commonly via BRAF amplification and mutations activating NRAS and MEK2. Our data confirming that MEK2 C125S, but not the synonymous MEK1 C121S protein, confers resistance to combination therapy highlight the functional differences between these kinases and the preponderance of MEK2 mutations in combination therapy-resistant melanomas. Exome sequencing did not identify additional progression-specific resistance candidates. Nevertheless, most melanomas carried additional oncogenic mutations at baseline (for example, RAC1 and AKT3) that activate the MAPK and PI3K pathways and are thus predicted to diminish response to MAPK inhibitors.},

abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or "batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes ( {\textgreater} 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

A continuum of transitional cell states exists between these discrete stages. We combine the depth of single-cell mass cytometry and an algorithm developed to leverage this continuum by aligning single cells of a given lineage onto a unified trajectory that accurately predicts the developmental path de novo. Applied to human B cell lymphopoiesis, the algorithm (termed Wanderlust) constructed trajectories spanning from hematopoietic stem cells through to naive B cells.

abstract = {Mature B-cell lymphoma is a clinically and biologically highly diverse disease. Its diagnosis and prognosis is a challenge due to its molecular heterogeneity and diverse regimes of biological dysfunctions, which are partly driven by epigenetic mechanisms. We here present an integrative analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression data of several lymphoma subtypes. Our study confirms previous results about the role of stemness genes during development and maturation of B-cells and their dysfunction in lymphoma locking in more proliferative or immune-reactive states referring to B-cell functionalities in the dark and light zone of the germinal center and also in plasma cells. These dysfunctions are governed by widespread epigenetic effects altering the promoter methylation of the involved genes, their activity status as moderated by histone modifications and also by chromatin remodeling. We identified four groups of genes showing characteristic expression and methylation signatures among Burkitt's lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma and multiple myeloma. These signatures are associated with epigenetic effects such as remodeling from transcriptionally inactive into active chromatin states, differential promoter methylation and the enrichment of targets of transcription factors such as EZH2 and SUZ12.},

abstract = {The expression level of a gene is often used as a proxy for determining whether the protein or RNA product is functional in a cell or tissue. Therefore, it is of fundamental importance to understand the global distribution of gene expression levels, and to be able to interpret it mechanistically and functionally. Here we use RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of mouse Th2 cells, coupled with a range of other techniques, to show that all genes can be separated, based on their expression abundance, into two distinct groups: one group comprised of lowly expressed and putatively non-functional mRNAs, and the other of highly expressed mRNAs with active chromatin marks at their promoters. These observations are confirmed in many other microarray and RNA-seq data sets of metazoan cell types. {\textcopyright} 2011 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {Illumina microarray is becoming a popular microarray platform. The BeadArray technology from Illumina makes its preprocessing and quality control different from other microarray technologies. Unfortunately, most other analyses have not taken advantage of the unique properties of the BeadArray system, and have just incorporated preprocessing methods originally designed for Affymetrix microarrays. lumi is a Bioconductor package especially designed to process the Illumina microarray data. It includes data input, quality control, variance stabilization, normalization and gene annotation portions. In specific, the lumi package includes a variance-stabilizing transformation (VST) algorithm that takes advantage of the technical replicates available on every Illumina microarray. Different normalization method options and multiple quality control plots are provided in the package. To better annotate the Illumina data, a vendor independent nucleotide universal identifier (nuID) was devised to identify the probes of Illumina microarray. The nuID annotation packages and output of lumi processed results can be easily integrated with other Bioconductor packages to construct a statistical data analysis pipeline for Illumina data.

We report here a genome-wide meta-analysis of 37,684 individuals with replication of selected variants in an additional 10,739 individuals. We identified seven loci, including five new loci, associated with mean LTL (P {\textless} 5 × 10 -8). Five of the loci contain candidate genes (TERC, TERT, NAF1, OBFC1 and RTEL1) that are known to be involved in telomere biology. Lead SNPs at two loci (TERC and TERT) associate with several cancers and other diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, a genetic risk score analysis combining lead variants at all 7 loci in 22,233 coronary artery disease cases and 64,762 controls showed an association of the alleles associated with shorter LTL with increased risk of coronary artery disease (21{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 5-35{\%}) per standard deviation in LTL, P = 0.014). Our findings support a causal role of telomere-length variation in some age-related diseases.},

We integrate experiments and theory to determine the trajectories that single BRAFV600E mutant melanoma cancer cells take between drug-naive and drug-tolerant states. Although single-cell omics tools can yield snapshots of the cell-state landscape, the determination of individual cell trajectories through that space can be confounded by stochastic cell-state switching. We assayed for a panel of signaling, phenotypic, and metabolic regulators at points across 5 days of drug treatment to uncover a cell-state landscape with two paths connecting drug-naive and drug-tolerant states. The trajectory a given cell takes depends upon the drug-naive level of a lineage-restricted transcription factor. Each trajectory exhibits unique druggable susceptibilities, thus updating the paradigm of adaptive resistance development in an isogenic cell population.},

Prior cross-sectional studies have investigated the combined effects of age and genetics on gene expression and alternative splicing; however, there has been no long-term, longitudinal characterization of these molecular changes, especially in older age. Results: We perform RNA sequencing in whole blood from the same individuals at ages 70 and 80 to quantify how gene expression, alternative splicing, and their genetic regulation are altered during this 10-year period of advanced aging at a population and individual level. We observe that individuals are more similar to their own expression profiles later in life than profiles of other individuals their own age. We identify 1291 and 294 genes differentially expressed and alternatively spliced with age, as well as 529 genes with outlying individual trajectories. Further, we observe a strong correlation of genetic effects on expression and splicing between the two ages, with a small subset of tested genes showing a reduction in genetic associations with expression and splicing in older age. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that, although the transcriptome and its genetic regulation is mostly stable late in life, a small subset of genes is dynamic and is characterized by a reduction in genetic regulation, most likely due to increasing environmental variance with age.},

The rate of genome generation is unprecedented, yet there is currently no coherent nor accepted scheme for naming the expanding phylogenetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we present a rational and dynamic virus nomenclature that uses a phylogenetic framework to identify those lineages that contribute most to active spread. Our system is made tractable by constraining the number and depth of hierarchical lineage labels and by flagging and delabelling virus lineages that become unobserved and hence are probably inactive. By focusing on active virus lineages and those spreading to new locations, this nomenclature will assist in tracking and understanding the patterns and determinants of the global spread of SARS-CoV-2.},

Coupled with a model selection mechanism, adapted to work for any stochastic clustering algorithm, NMF is an efficient method for identification of distinct molecular patterns and provides a powerful method for class discovery. We demonstrate the ability of NMF to recover meaningful biological information from cancer-related microarray data. NMF appears to have advantages over other methods such as hierarchical clustering or self-organizing maps. We found it less sensitive to a priori selection of genes or initial conditions and able to detect alternative or context-dependent patterns of gene expression in complex biological systems. This ability, similar to semantic polysemy in text, provides a general method for robust molecular pattern discovery.},

abstract = {The growing availability of single-cell data has sparked an increased interest in the inference of cell-cell communication from this data. Many tools have been developed for this purpose. Each of them consists of a resource of intercellular interactions prior knowledge and a method to predict potential cell-cell communication events. Yet the impact of the choice of resource and method on the resulting predictions is largely unknown. To shed light on this, we created a framework, available at https://github.com/saezlab/ligrec{\_}decoupler, to facilitate a comparative assessment of methods for inferring cell-cell communication from single cell transcriptomics data and then compared 15 resources and 6 methods. We found few unique interactions and a varying degree of overlap among the resources, and observed uneven coverage in terms of pathways and biological categories. We analysed a colorectal cancer single cell RNA-Seq dataset using all possible combinations of methods and resources. We found major differences among the highest ranked intercellular interactions inferred by each method even when using the same resources. The varying predictions lead to fundamentally different biological interpretations, highlighting the need to benchmark resources and methods. Findings • Built a framework to systematically combine 15 resources and 6 methods to estimate cell-cell communication from single-cell RNA data • Cell-cell communication resources are oen built from the same original databases and very few interactions are unique to a single resource. Yet overlap varies among resources and certain biological terms are unevenly represented • Different methods and resources provided notably different results • The observed disagreement among the methods could have a considerable impact on the interpretation of results},

abstract = {The Eurasian grapevine (Vitis vinifera) has long been important for wine production as well as being a food source. Despite being clonally propagated, modern cultivars exhibit great morphological and genetic diversity, with thousands of varieties described in historic and contemporaneous records. Through historical accounts, some varieties can be traced to the Middle Ages, but the genetic relationships between ancient and modern vines remain unknown. We present target-enriched genome-wide sequencing data from 28 archaeological grape seeds dating to the Iron Age, Roman era and medieval period. When compared with domesticated and wild accessions, we found that the archaeological samples were closely related to western European cultivars used for winemaking today. We identified seeds with identical genetic signatures present at different Roman sites, as well as seeds sharing parent–offspring relationships with varieties grown today. Furthermore, we discovered that one seed dated to {\~{}}1100 ce was a genetic match to ‘Savagnin Blanc', providing evidence for 900 years of uninterrupted vegetative propagation.},

abstract = {Molecular profiles of tumors and tumor-associated cells hold great promise as biomarkers of clinical outcomes. However, existing data sets are fragmented and difficult to analyze systematically. Here we present a pan-cancer resource and meta-analysis of expression signatures from {\^{a}}1/418,000 human tumors with overall survival outcomes across 39 malignancies. By using this resource, we identified a forkhead box MI (FOXM1) regulatory network as a major predictor of adverse outcomes, and we found that expression of favorably prognostic genes, including KLRB1 (encoding CD161), largely reflect tumor-associated leukocytes. By applying CIBERSORT, a computational approach for inferring leukocyte representation in bulk tumor transcriptomes, we identified complex associations between 22 distinct leukocyte subsets and cancer survival. For example, tumor-associated neutrophil and plasma cell signatures emerged as significant but opposite predictors of survival for diverse solid tumors, including breast and lung adenocarcinomas. This resource and associated analytical tools (http://precog.stanford.edu) may help delineate prognostic genes and leukocyte subsets within and across cancers, shed light on the impact of tumor heterogeneity on cancer outcomes, and facilitate the discovery of biomarkers and therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {Adjuvant systemic therapies are now routinely used following resection of stage III melanoma, however accurate prognostic information is needed to better stratify patients. We use differential expression analyses of primary tumours from 204 RNA-sequenced melanomas within a large adjuvant trial, identifying a 121 metastasis-associated gene signature. This signature strongly associated with progression-free (HR = 1.63, p = 5.24 × 10−5) and overall survival (HR = 1.61, p = 1.67 × 10−4), was validated in 175 regional lymph nodes metastasis as well as two externally ascertained datasets. The machine learning classification models trained using the signature genes performed significantly better in predicting metastases than models trained with clinical covariates (pAUROC = 7.03 × 10−4), or published prognostic signatures (pAUROC {\textless} 0.05). The signature score negatively correlated with measures of immune cell infiltration ($\rho$ = −0.75, p {\textless} 2.2 × 10−16), with a higher score representing reduced lymphocyte infiltration and a higher 5-year risk of death in stage II melanoma. Our expression signature identifies melanoma patients at higher risk of metastases and warrants further evaluation in adjuvant clinical trials.},

abstract = {Aging is a biological process that affects most cells, organisms and species. Telomeres have been postulated as a universal biological clock that shortens in parallel with aging in cells. Telomeres are located at the end of the chromosomes and consist of an evolutionary conserved repetitive nucleotide sequence ranging in length from a few hundred base pairs in yeast till several kilo base pairs in vertebrates. Telomeres associate with shelterin proteins and form a complex protecting the chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from recognition by the DNA damage-repair system. Due to the "end-replication problem" telomeres shorten with each mitotic cycle resulting in cumulative telomere attrition during aging. When telomeres reach a critical length the cell will not further undergo cell divisions and become senescent or otherwise dysfunctional. Telomere shortening has not only been linked to aging but also to several age associated diseases, including tumorigenesis, coronary artery disease, and heart failure. In the current review, we will discuss the role of telomere biology in relation to aging and aging associated diseases.},

However, the dynamics of this process at the individual level have not been characterized, hindering quantification of an individual's immune age. Here, we use multiple ‘omics' technologies to capture population- and individual-level changes in the human immune system of 135 healthy adult individuals of different ages sampled longitudinally over a nine-year period. We observed high inter-individual variability in the rates of change of cellular frequencies that was dictated by their baseline values, allowing identification of steady-state levels toward which a cell subset converged and the ordered convergence of multiple cell subsets toward an older adult homeostasis. These data form a high-dimensional trajectory of immune aging (IMM-AGE) that describes a person's immune status better than chronological age. We show that the IMM-AGE score predicted all-cause mortality beyond well-established risk factors in the Framingham Heart Study, establishing its potential use in clinics for identification of patients at risk.},

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Women's and men's responses in 16 general population surveys from 10 countries, analyzed by members of the International Research Group on Gender and Alcohol. MEASUREMENTS: Comparable measures of drinking, versus abstention, typical drinking frequencies and quantities, heavy episodic drinking, intoxication, morning drinking, and alcohol-related family and occupational problems. FINDINGS: Women and men differed little in the probability of currently drinking versus abstaining, but men consistently exceeded women in typical drinking frequencies and quantities and in rates of heavy drinking episodes and adverse drinking consequences, while women were consistently more likely than men to be life-time abstainers. In older age groups, both men and women drank smaller quantities of alcohol and were more likely to stop drinking altogether, but drinking frequencies did not change consistently with age. CONCLUSIONS: A theoretical synthesis proposes that gender roles may amplify biological differences in reactions to alcohol, and that gender differences in drinking behavior may be modified by macrosocial factors that modify gender role contrasts.},

abstract = {Motivation Pseudotime estimation from single-cell gene expression data allows the recovery of temporal information from otherwise static profiles of individual cells. Conventional pseudotime inference methods emphasize an unsupervised transcriptome-wide approach and use retrospective analysis to evaluate the behaviour of individual genes. However, the resulting trajectories can only be understood in terms of abstract geometric structures and not in terms of interpretable models of gene behaviour. Results Here we introduce an orthogonal Bayesian approach termed {\^{a}} - Ouija' that learns pseudotimes from a small set of marker genes that might ordinarily be used to retrospectively confirm the accuracy of unsupervised pseudotime algorithms. Crucially, we model these genes in terms of switch-like or transient behaviour along the trajectory, allowing us to understand why the pseudotimes have been inferred and learn informative parameters about the behaviour of each gene. Since each gene is associated with a switch or peak time the genes are effectively ordered along with the cells, allowing each part of the trajectory to be understood in terms of the behaviour of certain genes. We demonstrate that this small panel of marker genes can recover pseudotimes that are consistent with those obtained using the entire transcriptome. Furthermore, we show that our method can detect differences in the regulation timings between two genes and identify 'metastable' states-discrete cell types along the continuous trajectories-that recapitulate known cell types.},

abstract = {Despite its clinical importance, the SARS-CoV-2 gene set remains unresolved, hindering dissection of COVID-19 biology. We use comparative genomics to provide a high-confidence protein-coding gene set, characterize evolutionary constraint, and prioritize functional mutations. We select 44 Sarbecovirus genomes at ideally-suited evolutionary distances, and quantify protein-coding evolutionary signatures and overlapping constraint. We find strong protein-coding signatures for ORFs 3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9b, and a novel alternate-frame gene, ORF3c, whereas ORFs 2b, 3d/3d-2, 3b, 9c, and 10 lack protein-coding signatures or convincing experimental evidence of protein-coding function. Furthermore, we show no other conserved protein-coding genes remain to be discovered. Mutation analysis suggests ORF8 contributes to within-individual fitness but not person-to-person transmission. Cross-strain and within-strain evolutionary pressures agree, except for fewer-than-expected within-strain mutations in nsp3 and S1, and more-than-expected in nucleocapsid, which shows a cluster of mutations in a predicted B-cell epitope, suggesting immune-avoidance selection. Evolutionary histories of residues disrupted by spike-protein substitutions D614G, N501Y, E484K, and K417N/T provide clues about their biology, and we catalog likely-functional co-inherited mutations. Previously reported RNA-modification sites show no enrichment for conservation. Here we report a high-confidence gene set and evolutionary-history annotations providing valuable resources and insights on SARS-CoV-2 biology, mutations, and evolution.},
